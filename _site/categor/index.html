		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2013/08/15/the-summer-vacation-reading-issue/" title="<p>FINALLY. Vacation. Long overdue and a chance to catch up on some reading. Here’s what I’m taking to the beach:</p>

<p><em>The Guy Davenport Reader</em>. I’ve read <em>Geographies of the Imagination</em> and <em>A Table of Green Fields</em>, which is incomprehensibly wonderful,  so this looks like an irresistible collection. </p>

<p><em>Hypothermia</em>, by Álvaro Enrigue. I’ve been waiting a long time for this collection, since reading Enrigue’s <a href="http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/on-the-death-of-the-author"><em>On the Death of the Author</em></a> at Words Without Borders.</p>

<p><em>Hawthorne &amp; Child</em>, by Keith Ridgway. I’m going in blind on this. The publisher (my client) is enthusiastic about it and there’s a blurb by Zadie Smith that says it’s “idiosyncratic” and another blurb that says that it’s “unpredictable.” Sounds good to me.</p>

<p><em>The Infatuations</em>, by Javier Marías. I often say that I never recommend Marías to anyone because you have to have a special patience for his writing (e.g. five minute scenes stretching out 80 pages or more), but I love his work, having read the <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em> trilogy and several other works of his (<em>A Heart So White</em> being another fave). </p>

<p>I think that’s it. I’ve been perusing a few things to take along but haven’t settled on anything. I wish there were a Bolaño I haven’t read. I’ll also be finishing up <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, which I’ve been reading with my son this year, though I have to take it slow because he gets upset if I get ahead of him, and he too is a grazer. I used to read a Shakespeare play every summer, but I think I have enough on my plate and it always makes me talk funny.</p>

<p>As you can tell, I’m not a pulp beach reader. Vacation is one of the few times I can immerse myself in a bit of reading these days, so I hate to waste that time. </p>

		<li><a href="/article/2013/03/10/mixing-future-and-past-dated-entries-in-wordpress-with-date-based-filters/" title="&lt;p&gt;We build web properties for publishers who are often promoting books that are not yet published. In Wordpress we treat the publish date of an entry as the publish date of the book. This presents a few problems in Wordpress showing yet-to-be-published entries, but we’ve been able to solve them with filters. Action hooks and filters are the most powerful feature of Wordpress, in my view. Used concisely and judiciously, they give you great control over how your content is displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

Everything makes sense to me: immediately hitting readers with something to read, and nary a pixel wasted. The site’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">reponsiveness</a> is superb, simply because they must have designed mobile first, something that is more difficult than it may seem. However, this tablet-centric design is not for everyone. <em>Quartz</em> is streaming news, so their design is unique to the problems of presenting a lot of news to an audience with a short attention span.</p>

This is President Obama talking about that event with The Rolling Stone:</p>
<blockquote>Here's what I love about Dylan: He was exactly as you'd expect he would be. He wouldn't come to the rehearsal; usually, all these guys are practicing before the set in the evening. He didn't want to take a picture with me; usually all the talent is dying to take a picture with me and Michelle before the show, but he didn't show up to that. He came in and played "The Times They Are A-Changin'." A beautiful rendition. The guy is so steeped in this stuff that he can just come up with some new arrangement, and the song sounds completely different. Finishes the song, steps off the stage — I'm sitting right in the front row — comes up, shakes my hand, sort of tips his head, gives me just a little grin, and then leaves. And that was it — then he left. That was our only interaction with him. And I thought: That's how you want Bob Dylan, right? You don't want him to be all cheesin' and grinnin' with you. You want him to be a little skeptical about the whole enterprise. So that was a real treat.</blockquote>

Making explicit what we more or less understood, Fulton Armstrong, a former U.S. Intelligence Officer, writes, in a letter to the editor of <em><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/aug/19/cia-and-wmds-damning-evidence/?pagination=false">The New York Review of Books</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>When we on the National Intelligence Council finally got a full read of the National Intelligence Estimate on WMDs, after its publication, a couple of us expressed grave reservations about the fatally weak evidence and the obsessively one-sided interpretation of what shreds of information it contained. (We were not told at the time that “Curveball” was a solitary source of obviously questionable credentials, nor that contradictory evidence was actually suppressed from the intelligence collection and dissemination process.) One colleague said it was clearly a paper written to provide a rationale for a predetermined policy decision to go to war. When I challenged the lack of evidence and the lack of alternative explanations, including forcing the questions raised by the INR into a lowly footnote, one of the WMD-promoting NIOs leaned forward and bellowed: “Who are you to question this paper? Even <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>The New York Times</em> agree with us.” The irony was complete: previously respected reporters, spoon-fed by Bush administration officials, were now being used to provide cover for the NIOs’ similar compromise in accepting the administration’s view.</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Powers, who wrote the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/may/27/how-they-got-their-bloody-way/">article</a> (about a book by Robert Jervis on the topic), replies, beginning:</p>
<blockquote>Fulton Armstrong’s important letter states as fact something Americans have been resisting for sixty years—that presidents tell the CIA not only what to do, but what to say. By Americans I do not mean only ordinary citizens puzzling over intelligence flaps every few years, but observers thought to be sophisticated, like professors, senators of long experience, foreign policy professionals, and reporters for serious newspapers. Armstrong describes the reality about as plainly as I have ever seen it done in his letter explaining the source of error in the CIA’s insistently wrong estimate of the progress of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in its purported effort to develop weapons of mass destruction.</blockquote>
<p>One takeaway from this exchange (upon reading it in its entirety ) is that not much has changed in terms of the underlying problems. Whenever I begin to think I should be less cynical about politics and the media, I come across something like this. Cynicism never goes out of style.</p>

There’s no reason for there not to be links within an app, for instance, and there’s no reason to think that the developers are ignorant of that fact. Yet, I’ve seen complaints about the lack of links and other fairly trivial aspects of iPad apps from several, usually more <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/i-prefer-safari-to-content-apps-on-the-ipad.html">perspicacious</a>, sources. While conceding that some publisher’s misguided belief they’ve “rethought” the magazine are so far off the mark, we should be looking at apps in context of readers, journalism, and the Web. Considering that apps are in their early stages of development vis-á-vis the browser’s relatively long history, news apps have got a leap ahead of Web sites in reader-experience terms alone.</p>

Twenty or so people gathered in a beautiful Manhattan apartment with the treat of having the renowned poet, and president of the Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, Edward Hirsch read to us from the anthology. It’s a massive collection so to pick a couple of poems to represent the whole is difficult, but Hirsch picked one that I think actually represents the challenges of poetry and translation. The poem is Velimir Khlebnikov’s “Incantation by Laughter” in which Khlebnikov riffs, in Russian, on the various ways to express laughter in his language. Paul Schmidt did a fantastic job of creating something that I have to imagine recreates the original while creating something wholly new. Here are the first five lines:</p>

<blockquote>Philip Roth recently said that reading novels would be a “cultic” activity in 25 years, adding that “the book can’t compete with the screen.” Do other writers share his pessimism? How does the situation differ across cultures and continents—and are there lessons in those differences?</blockquote>
<p>Instead, the discussion dwelled on trivialities like the “Toy Story” (a movie, if for some strange reason you don’t know it) app on the iPad, which in my view has little do with the type of literature everyone on the panel writes and entirely mocks the issue. I highly doubt Roth was being so obvious when he said that. Or… maybe I’m just grumpy, other commenters on the panel weren’t so disappointed.</p>

<div class="im">To be honest, I'm not a big fan of book reviews, generally. We have some writers who are exceptional at writing book reviews, and I would happily read their thoughts on every book they pick up. However, I think the traditional newspaper book review can be rather boring.</div>
When a review comes across my desk, I often haven't read the book in question (I can only read so much) and I may not be particularly interested in reading the book, but if I am still nonetheless interested in reading the review on its own terms, then the review is a success. Many, many book reviews, from those in newspapers to those on the lowliest website, do not pass this test.

		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2010/03/22/a-jazz-lexicon-a-unique-and-rebellious-way-of-speaking/" title="<p>Another find while packing (see my previous post on <a href="http://budparr.posterous.com/take-the-scenic-route-to-knowledge-on-brewers"><em>Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</em></a>) is Bob Gold’s <em>A Jazz Lexicon</em> from 1964. My copy is signed “To the Richardson All-Stars - Richie, Johnnie, Jon &amp; Brooke - with love, Bob Gold 7/23/64” A quick look on the internet and some of my other jazz books gave me no clue to who those guys were but the inscription gives it a nice sense of authenticity and begs the history of the book; how it might have found it’s way from someone in the Richardson All-Stars to a used bookstore in Brookyn, where I bought it.</p>
<div>This dictionary is for 20th Century slang from the jazz set. I found a letter to the editor of the New York Review of Books by the author on the use of the word "hep:"</div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">Your recent correspondent, Cal Kolbe Nossiter, in attempting to correct Philip Rahv's nominal use of "hip" merely proliferates the error by identifying the term "hip" as a variant of "hep." Anyone familiar with the jazz scene (or anyone familiar with my recent dictionary of jazz slang, A Jazz Lexicon) knows that the word has always been "hip," and that "hep" is hopelessly square.</blockquote>
<div>For instance, "pork chop"</div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">[prob. from jazzman's approval of both; according to jazzmen, current c. 1900-c 1917, obs. since; see also BARRELHOUSE, GULLY-LOW, LOWDOWN] Slow, earthy blues music. Oral evidence only.</blockquote>
<div>To "collar the jive" was a phrase used by Cab Calloway and part of general slang earlier in the century to mean "to understand and fee rapport with what is being said; to be in the know; to be hip. c1935 jive term."</div>
<div>Like the <em>Brewer's Dictionary</em>, it's tempting to write these words off as quaint, particularly much of the drug-culture related slang, but here especially they represent a history, one with sociological resonance, as Gold points out in his introduction: "...So we get a people in rebellion against a dominant majority, but forced to rebel secretly, to sublimate, as the psychologist would put it--to express themselves culturally through the medium of jazz, and linguistically through a code, a jargon..."</div>
<div>And because much of the language from the early jazz era was spoken, its presence here is all the more remarkable. As much as I love my lovely found hardback copy, if there were ever a case for the digitization of books, having this now out-of-print history of a special set of words is an acute one.</div>

		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2010/03/19/take-the-scenic-route-to-knowledge-on-brewer-s-dictionary-of-phrase-fable/" title="<p>Packing my books away for our move, I keep running into great things I’ve not looked at in a while. One of them is <em>Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable</em>. I love dictionaries and reference books in the first place–have quite a few–but this one is truly unique. My edition is from 1970, the “Centenary Edition” as it was first published in 1870. To its credit, it’s never been out of print, but truth is, even though there’s a newer edition out this year even, it doesn’t matter to me because the old dictionaries show words to be something of an artifact and etymologies don’t really capture how meaning evolves (or devolves!, as the case may be).</p>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>The definition for "screw" goes like this:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">"Slang for wages, salary; possibly because in some employments it was handed out in 'screwed up on paper' or because it was 'screwed out' of one's employer; it is also slang for a prison warder, from the days when the locks were operated from a screw-like movement."</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Modern definitions, while much more thorough, are, needless to say, nothing like this one. Likewise, "Screwed" is defined here as "intoxicated. A playful synonym of <em>tight</em>." Of course in a modern context these definitions seem merely quaint, but there are tons of things here that just don't exist now either.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You'll find entries, for example, with stories like that of "John o' Groats":</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">"The site of a legendary house 1 3/4 miles west of Duncansby Head Caithness, Scotland. The story is of...three Dutch brothers, came to this part of Scotland in the reign of James IV. There came to be eight families of the name and they met annually to celebrate. On once occasion a question of precedency arose, consequently John o'Groat built an eight-sided room with a door to each side and placed an octagonal table therein so that all were 'head of the table'. This building went ever after with the name of John o' Groat's House."</blockquote>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>At any rate, Dr Ebenezer Cobham Brewer was, as far as I can tell from his biography in the "Centenary Edition," a man who did little besides read, write and garden. The list of books he wrote or edited is astounding, beginning in 1841 (Brewer was born in 1810) with <em>A Guide to Science</em>, which went into 47 editions and sold more than 319,000 copies by 1905. He wrote books on accounting, scripture, Greek, Roman, French history, as well as a <em>Political, Social, and Literary History of Germany</em>, and near the end of his life, <em>A Dictionary of Miracles</em>.</div>

<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve become addicted to your iPhone in the oddest ways, even though the phone service itself is horrible.

But I&#8217;ve yet to be convinced that it&#8217;s worth paying for any books there besides maybe something to read in an emergency &#8211; you do know about reading emergencies, don&#8217;t you? </p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, despite the promise of e-readers, the so-called &#8220;long-tail&#8221; doesn&#8217;t yet exist. When the entire backlist of New Directions, Dalkey Archive and so on are available in the Kindle store, then maybe. </p>

That said, when one looks to be surprised by a work of fiction, it is all the more difficult to be caught out. To hope to be surprised, to look forward expectantly to being taken by surprise, is more than likely to cancel out the possibility. And what do I mean after all by surprise here? Everything original in the best sense is surprising in its way, which is to say that the great books continue to surprise even though our prior experience with them lets us think (gives us that jading illusion) that we know what&#8217;s coming next. Once we are familiar with the twists of a surprising plot, unless we have conveniently faulty memories, we can never be surprised by them again. The books I&#8217;ve admired, and continue to admire, have other ways of engendering surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A favorite quote of mine from the French filmmaker Robert Bresson exhorts the artist &#8220;to bring together things that had not been brought together before and had not been predisposed to be so.&#8221; That&#8217;s the kind of surprise I believe I&#8217;m talking about&mdash;the surprise of flying in the face of the received rules. The writer among my contemporaries, whom I find the most surprising and therefore the most admirable, is Robert Coover, a household name only in the most enlightened households. Virtually all of Coover&#8217;s fictions tend to have the quality of surprise that the Bresson quote refers to, which is at least one determinant of their&#8217; pleasure for me. If I have to choose a single book of Coover&#8217;s to recommend, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m committed to doing, I would choose the seemingly modest novella, the playful, mock-pornographic, &#8220;Spanking the Maid&#8221;&mdash;a book I&#8217;ve presented to my classes at Brooklyn College over and over again&#8212;because (and why not?) the choice is itself a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2008/11/07/your-face-tomorrow-dance-and-dream-by-javier-marias/" title="<p> How to describe <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em>? Its title tells us nothing about what happens in the book and the subtitles of the individual volumes (it&#8217;s a three volume novel, two of which have so far been translated into English and published by New Directions), &#8220;Fever and Spear&#8221; and &#8220;Dance and Dream&#8221; are not quite motifs but something like mental markers, like, perhaps, the titles given to Abstract impressionist paintings. While there is action and even a story in <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em> I think it would be unfair to describe this novel that way. The story follows Jack Deza, an urbane Spaniard in England whose wife has left him, as he gets a job in the British Secret Service judging the truthfulness (loosely termed) of the unwitting diplomats, spies and other characters who pass through the agency&#8217;s halls. While that story certainly has potential, I would mislead you if I told you that&#8217;s what the book is about. Everything that happens in a Mar&iacute;as novel is a colorful backdrop or even pretext for ruminating on the subject Jack or his creator are thinking about. And that&#8217;s closer to the point than the story in and of itself. </p>
<p>Javier Mar&iacute;as&#8217;s  extravagantly digressive writing ranges from sensuous to dialectical and meditative, but occasionally banal to the point of distraction. Like Lauren Hutton&#8217;s gapped teeth this can be endearing rather than a flaw that would make lesser writers intolerable, but for a writer who can easily stretch a five minute event through 70 or 80 pages or a sentence to Proustian proportions, he seems willing to risk breaking the rhythm so crucial to his style for the sake of grounding his characters with an awkward, sometimes puzzling naturalistic whimsy. </p>
<p>In <em>Dance and Dream</em>, volume two of the <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em> trilogy, Deza is ordered by his mysterious quasi-secret agent boss Tupra to search the toilets for a eurotrash diplomat and a dignitary&#8217;s wife who&#8217;ve gone astray together in a London nightclub. This bathroom scene &#8211; a great deal of this second volume takes place in the toilet, although it might be more accurate to say it takes place inside Deza&#8217;s mind &#8211; begins on page 89 and ends nearly 70 pages later with Deza&#8217;s thoughts just walking out the door of the toilet starting from page 121. </p>
<p>The scene encompasses not only his search of the nightclub&#8217;s restrooms but ruminations on themes began in the novel&#8217;s first volume <em>Fever and Spear</em> such as meditations on violence and the Spanish Civil War, &#8211; Deza&#8217;s father survived the war from the losing side but not without a great deal of suffering &#8211; remorse over estrangement from his wife who is still in Spain, and the tiny detail of a drop of blood, which occupies a central point in volume one and reappears in a different although related context here. The drop of blood takes on many symbolic possibilities but at the least it creates a bond between volume one and two, endowing the primary setting of both books with a physical puzzlement and the novelistic possibilities of questioning its source.</p>
<p>This is why we read Mar&iacute;as, for his thoughts keyed by the events at hand, events that seem inconsequential for their only purpose is to provoke Deza, to spur his brooding, to lead us through his history or the history of his country, to watch from afar the way we humans treat one another, how we behave when we&#8217;re alone. Besides these larger themes, Deza&#8217;s mind dips into country song lyrics, women&#8217;s legs &#8211; &#8220;So there it was, that line of legs&#8221; &#8211; and naturally, the state of the toilets. In a later scene in the restrooms for the disabled, he muses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;equally generous was the excellent lighting, intended, I assumed, to avoid the possibility of any stumbles, everything was new and spotless, gleaming and even welcoming, without any of the sordid elements so frequent in public toilets. It was admirable that people should show such respect for the disabled of Britain, that they did not cheerfully invade it and soil and besmirch it, as is the norm among men and optional among women.&#8221; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as vaguely naive or even silly, yet a few moments later, more or less, banality veers into a nearly absurd act of violence. Here Mar&iacute;as revels in the detail of the moment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I saw the look on his face, the look of someone who thinks or knows he is dead; but since he was still alive, the image was one of infinite fear and struggle, mental struggle, perhaps of desire&#8217; of childish, undisguised terror, his mouth must have dried instantly, as instantly as his face turned deathly pale, just as if someone had give his face a quick lick of grey or off-white or queasy-colored paint, or had thrown flour over him or perhaps talcum powder, it was rather like when swift clouds cast a shadow over the fields and a shudder runs through the flocks below, or like the hand that spreads the plague or closes the eyes of the deceased.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read in a recent <a href="http://theparisreview.com/viewinterview.php/prmMID/5680">Paris Review</a> interview that Mar&iacute;as writes as he goes, intensively focusing on one section at a time, never looking back on a passage. It&#8217;s easy to muse that the inconsistencies, if you could call them that, in his writing might be due to a lack of coffee one day, or too much, or a Laurel and Hardy movie on television, maybe a song on the radio, a random phone call from a friend. The fact that he pulls this off, at least in my view,  says a lot about Mar&iacute;as. He is not a writer for everyone, indeed I&#8217;d call him something of an intellectual elitist, both in tone and content, but to unflinchingly transcend story as he does puts him in a rare category of writer.</p>

		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2008/07/15/classics-on-edith-wharton-by-roxana-robinson/" title="<p>I&#8217;ve always been drawn to Edith Wharton&#8217;s work, partly because of its astonishing combination of elegance and urgency, and partly because her world is so familiar.</p>
<p>Wharton and I come from similar backgrounds. I grew up with the rules that governed her: emotions were to be strictly controlled, pain was not to be acknowledged, and the rules of decorum were to be obeyed. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by her unblinking exegesis of all this, the way you are when someone breaks the rules, the way you are when you read something and think, &#8220;What? Are you allowed to write about this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wharton wrote about her world in a way that made it possible for me &#8211; and for all of us who come after her &#8211; to go into our own worlds still further, and to tease out the innermost reaches of pain and passion from the decorous woven fabric of our lives.</p>
<p>The following is excerpted with permission from the introduction to <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=7152"><em>The New York Stories of Edith Wharton</em></a>:</p>
<p>A writer&#8217;s world both shelters and confines, and she must write her way both into and out of it. She must form her own world, but it will always be part of the one that formed her. It will always be both beginning and end of her journey.</p>
<p>Edith Newbold Jones was born in 1862, in the family brownstone on West 23rd Street. Her forebears were Dutch, English and Huguenot &#8211; a long line of successful merchants, bankers and lawyers. They were well-established, and at the time of her birth, Edith&#8217;s family had lived in New York for nearly two hundred years. Old New York was an insular, tribal society, with a rigid caste system and a strict code of behaviour. The code of manners governed all aspects of behaviour, including frivolous ones of social comportment. At the core of this code, however, was a stern Puritan ethos of moral rectitude, self-reliance and a stoic disregard of pain. Edith learned the rules of this formal, restrained world, but she also felt the presence of another, unacknowledged one. This held emotions and ideas, and it seethed around her like an invisible mist. Wharton learned the power of the secret, forbidden realm, that the laws of decorum were set up to control and counteract. The conflict between these worlds &#8211; the mannered, mandarin one, and the passionate, uncontrollable one  &#8211; would provide the central dynamic of her work.</p>
<p>Despite moving to Europe, Wharton never gave up her American citizenship, however, and her deepest literary and  emotional connections always remained to her world &#8211; Old New York. Her first novel, a historical romance called The Valley of Decision, was set in Italy. When it was published, in 1902, Henry James had famously advised her: &#8220;Use the American subject! Do New York! There it is round you.&#8221; But New York was already Wharton&#8217;s subject; she had been &#8220;doing&#8221; it in stories for over a decade, and would continue throughout her career. New York was the center of her life, the place where she had struggled most ardently with conflicting claims of manners and passion, the place where her heart had beat most powerfully; where her soul had seemed most desperately constrained and her happiness most perilously at risk. In her work, New York received her greatest scrutiny, sternest criticism and deepest understanding. It was her greatest subject. In her New York stories, we find all of Wharton&#8217;s great themes: stifled passion and the suffocating soul; the conflict between idealism and pragmatism; the charged erotic constellation of marriage, adultery, divorce and betrayal.</p>
<p>One of the richest and most fertile themes in Wharton&#8217;s work was that of the complicated connection between love and pain. Wharton&#8217;s own romantic history was not happy: her first engagement was broken off, not by her. A second romantic relationship, disappointingly, did not produce an offer. Her marriage to Teddy Wharton was neither passionate nor fulfilling, and ended in misery. Her brief erotic engagement with Morton Fullerton was wounding. These experiences are reflected in her fiction: rarely are her central male characters both sympathetic andeffective. Those who are sympathetic are often passive or uncommitted; those who are powerful are often evasive and opaque, solipsistic or brutal. The presence of a subtle emotional sadism runs like a dark undercurrent through Wharton&#8217;s fiction. The same troubling theme is strikingly present in &#8220;The Dilettante,&#8221; written in 1903, long before her affair. Perhaps her most shocking story, &#8220;The Dilettante&#8221; is a subtle disquisition on cruelty. Thursdale, an idle and worldly bachelor, maintains an amitie amoureusewith Mrs. Vervain, an elegant divorcee. Cold, cynical and controlling, Thursdale considers their relationship, and the &#8220;emotional training&#8221; he has given Mrs. Vervain. As the narrative unfolds we learn of his decision to marry &#8211; though not, of course, the well-schooled Mrs. Vervain. He has found a fresh, untainted young woman. With sublime effrontery he asks his mistress to support his marriage suit, persuading the young fiancee of Thursdale&#8217;s worth. The lethal potency of the story arises partly from Mrs. Vervain&#8217;s intelligence and vitality: she seems to have deliberately chosen this ghastly thralldom, this humiliating emotional martyrdom. In return for it she receives only a cruel intimacy. Love is what she wants, but it is not offered,  and she is too well-trained to make a scene.</p>
<p>Wharton wrote brilliantly right up to the end of her life, and &#8220;Roman Fever,&#8221; of 1934, just three years before her death, is one of her great stories. It is not a quiet rumination on mortality, but the summoning up of rage, stifled passion, and sexuality: a remarkable work for a woman of seventy-two.</p>
<p>Though the story is set entirely on a rooftop terrace in contemporary Rome, Old New York is a looming presence, and provides the background of &#8220;two American ladies of ripe but well-cared for middle age.&#8221; Friends since childhood, brownstone neighbours on East 73rd Street, now both widowed and the mothers of two marriageable daughters, the two sit      decorously watching the sunset &#8220;&#8230;contemplating it in silence, with a sort of diffused serenity which might have been borrowed from the spring effulgence of the Roman skies.&#8221;  Mrs. Slade thinks slightingly that her friend&#8217;s late husband &#8220;was &#8211; well, just the duplicate of his wife. Museum specimens of old New York. Good looking, irreproachable, exemplary.&#8221; Slowly, through dialogue and flashbacks, the two recall their young womanhood,  inducting us into its secret sisterhood as they remember a common visit to Rome some twenty-five years earlier. If New York represents a moribund rigidity, Rome embodies a dark, charged vitality, worldly and unfathomable. The fever of the title refers to malaria, a fatal nineteenth-century disease and a real threat before the Roman marshes were drained. Fever was the ostensible reason for keeping young women inside during the evenings. The risk of illness was real, but so was the other, unspoken reason for sequestration &#8211; sexual adventure, with its terrifying consequences.</p>
<p>Seated overlooking a ravishing twilit view of Rome, with its &#8220;great accumulated wreckage of passion and splendor,&#8221; the women are carried by the march of memory, to  the rising rhythm of animosity, through a landscape of jealousy and deception, illicit assignations, sexual thrall and unwed pregnancy. It is a virtuoso&#8217;s performance, and Wharton&#8217;s greatest story of old New York may be this one, set in Rome. Here Wharton reverts to her most enduring theme, the power of passion. It is passion that has driven the lives of these two decorous matrons, and it is passion that reveals itself anew, as they sit in the splendor of the Roman sunset.</p>
<p>Edith Wharton&#8217;s lifetime spanned the Victorian era, the First World War, the Jazz Age, and the Depression. It was a period of enormous transitions, and subject to the competing forces of conservatism and modernism. The great changes she witnessed are reflected in her work, against the backdrop of old New York. Wharton&#8217;s writing is difficult to place. She schooled herself by reading non-fiction: history, philosophy and scientific theory. This gave her a firm intellectual grounding and a rational, analytical approach to the world. She admired the novel of ideas, and the work of George Eliot and George Sand. Because of the elevated social circles of her characters, as well as the subtlety and nuance of her work, she has often been compared to Henry James, a mentor and friend. James was a very different sort of writer, however, and his vision was interior and more mysterious than hers. Wharton&#8217;s work had more clarity and directness, more boldness and drama.</p>
<p>Wharton wrote about the twentieth century, but, by her formal, ceremonial style and her belief in a moral order, she was linked inextricably to the nineteenth. The next generation of writers &#8211; Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald, among others.  &#8211; shared a sense of post-war disillusionment, and they experimented with literary styles that reflected the fractured rhythms of the twentieth century. Despite her decorous style, however, Wharton is anything but prim. Her work is informed by candor, clarity, and a deep  understanding of the great subversive force of the emotions. Perhaps only one for whom the life of the emotions has been so explicitly forbidden can truly understand the potency of that life.</p>
<p>Wharton&#8217;s work was overlooked for many years because of its awkward placement, stranded between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Returned now to its rightful prominence in the history of American letters, it offers a profound and moving reflection on desire and its consequences, on freedom and its limits, in American life. Her New York stories show Edith Wharton&#8217;s world as she knew it. They show the crystalline brilliance of Wharton&#8217;s literary style; they show the intellectual reach and the complexity of her mind. They show the courage, depth, and compassion of her heart. They show her to be one of our greatest short story writers.</p>

<br />
&#8220;They never forget what they are, or all the things they have to do, but for a few minutes, maybe an hour or two, they put themselves between parentheses, and I bear the name of that thing in their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p><br /><br />
To choose one word to describe Dominique Fabre&#8217;s <a href="http://www.archipelagobooks.org/bk.php?id=41"><em>The Waitress Was New</em></a> it would have to be &#8220;quiet.&#8221; A short novel of 117 pages, Fabre&#8217;s first translated into English, <em>The Waitress Was New</em> is a peek into the consciousness of a Parisian bartender over three days at the end of his career. </p>
<p>The story begins as Pierre is introduced to a new waitress at La Cercle, a small, non-descript restaurant on the outskirts of Paris:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>	&#8220;What I really wanted to say was &#8216;Welcome to the Club,&#8217; and then give her some tips on the questions she was probably going to ask. The boss isn&#8217;t much of a talker, but he&#8217;s him and I&#8217;m me. I&#8217;m only the oldest employee of Le Cercle, which is the caf&eacute; where I work, across from the Asni&eacute;res train station, where there&#8217;s nothing to see but people coming and going out&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;She had a firm grip, when she let go I noticed she had a big wedding ring on her left hand, and I wondered if that&#8217;s really where it&#8217;s supposed to go. That was all too long ago for me, maybe I&#8217;d forgotten. Still, I&#8217;d stayed married for eight years, I was a young man then. I kept my ring on at first. Then I put it in my nightstand drawer. I lost a lot of illusions, but not her. My ex remarried, lived happily; and had two children. Then unhappily, and still two children. Then we lost touch. Her name was Marie, like my adoptive mother. The boss looked around, he&#8217;d picked up his cigarillo again.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pierre is matter-of-factly attuned to his environment because he is the one person not passing through. He&#8217;s a fixture like the bar itself. He listens more than he talks, he observes more than he listens. But for his attentiveness he doesn&#8217;t seem to learn much. He acts as though he understand others&#8217; relationships but his own are withered, distant or shallow. He thinks he gets what&#8217;s going on around him but then is sideswiped by the truth. Much of the novel surrounds the disappearance of &#8220;the boss&#8221; (which in French is, I think, &#8220;le boss&#8221;) and everyone&#8217;s speculation, including the boss&#8217;s wife, that he&#8217;s having an affair with one of the restaurant&#8217;s former waitresses. Pierre stumbles confidently through what seems to him a given only to be met later by the truth and throughout he never truly doubts himself.</p>
<p>In depicting someone on the side of society (not on the margins, just side, if you will) Fabre slips into a barely comfortable pathos. Pierre is neither particularly likable or unlikeable and his existence appears without purpose or meaning. The affect is a lack of tension such that we pity Pierre &#8211; the man can&#8217;t even bring himself to masturbate &#8211; but don&#8217;t care about the outcome of the story. This is why I think of <em>The Waitress Was New</em> as quiet. It doesn&#8217;t try to draw attention to itself, just like Pierre. If we had any doubts of Pierre as something of an anti-hero, Fabre casts him firmly against Pierre&#8217;s own reading material that he, naturally, learns about through a customer at the bar: Primo Levi&#8217;s <em>If this is a Man</em> &#8220;the story of a Jewish Italian resistance fighter who lived through the concentration camps, he wanted to bear witness.&#8221; &#8220;Now there&#8217;s somebody I&#8217;d like to have as a customer,&#8221; says Pierre of Levi. </p>
<p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/bartender_thumb.png" style="float:right;margin-left:18px" alt="altimage" /> Where Fabre excels is accreting pieces of Pierre&#8217;s world into a somewhat whole portrait. While the drama is not exactly intense during our brief time with Pierre and Le Cercle, Fabre wastes not a word, packing in layers of detail in every paragraph. Looking at the quote above (beginning with &#8220;What I really wanted to say), Pierre gives us glimpses of the new waitress (married, probably strong-willed), the boss (silent type, which might be odd for a restaurant owner, owns a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris, smokes cigarillos), Pierre&#8217;s ex-wife (divorced, happy, two children, unhappy) and himself (long-time employee of Le Cercle with a fondness for his job, older, divorcee, adopted). </p>
<p>Of course, our observations are limited to what goes through Pierre&#8217;s mind, leaving sketches of the boss, the new waitress, the bosses wife and other characters merely impressions. We can only come as close to them as Pierre and he is nothing more than an onlooker on these lives, but still the richness lies in what we don&#8217;t know about them. I suspect in reading this novel that I&#8217;ve come a little closer to a life about which I knew nothing before, the kind of life that I might pass by with little thought. I may not be any closer than Pierre comes to his customers, filling in blanks where needed with imagination, but that is an oddly compelling pastime. </p>

		<li><a href="/article/2007/11/05/considering-the-classics-re-kipling/" title="&lt;p&gt;We all have our favorite books, and not a few of us are probably influenced by those we read when we were children. But often when we go back and look again, they&#8217;re disappointing; we see their tricks and the manipulations of an author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those books, though, were remarkably able to touch both children and adults, and for me, there is nothing quite like Kipling&#8217;s &#8220;The Jungle Book,&#8221; published in 1894, which affected me as a child and still has a hold on me. I particularly mean the first one (he published &#8220;The Second Jungle Book&#8221; a year later) and its three stories about Mowgli, the wolf-boy, although it&#8217;s hard not to love &#8220;Rikki-tikki-tavi,&#8221; which records the life-saving battle between a loyal mongoose and a particularly nasty cobra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You read these stories today and you say, &#8220;Wow!&#8221; Mowgli is a far more interesting character than his epigone, Tarzan, even if he has power approaching those of a superhero. (He can speak bird and snake and tiger, and so on; and, when the time comes, learns human speech.) Kipling doesn&#8217;t anthropomorphize, or not much, but Mowgli&#8217;s friendships with Bagheera, the gentle, deadly black panther, and Baloo, the professorial bear, and the wolves who reared him, are touching and realized. Kaa, the rock python, and the loathsome Bandar-log &#8211; the amoral monkey tribe &#8211; are grand fictional characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kipling was such an accomplished stylist, too; in the 1890s &#8211; in the time after Dickens and before Arnold Bennett &#8211; he wrote clean, elegant sentences that leapt beyond the stilted prose his place and time. Hemingway might have written this from &#8220;Tiger-Tiger,&#8221; the third Mowgli story: &#8220;At one end stood a little village, and at the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds, and stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe.&#8221; In that story, Kipling does something that I never understood when I was a kid: He writes from Mowgli&#8217;s point of view, but also through the eyes of Indian villagers, who are startled by this boy (by now about twelve or thirteen) who can&#8217;t communicate and appears to have bites all over his body.  And Kipling being Kipling, he stage-manages a fine adventure in which Mowgli finally confronts Shere Khan, the vengeful tiger who has stalked him since he was a baby, left in the jungle and adopted by the wolf pack.&lt;/p&gt;

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.&#8221;</p>

<br />
      - Longinus, On the Sublime<br /><br /><br />
While at one of my favorite bookstores, <a href="http://threelives.com/" title="Three Lives and Company">Three Lives and Company</a>, “The People’s Act of Love” came up. Several of us chimed in enthusiastically and I reminded myself that this was one of the (many) books I never managed to write about last year. So here I attempt amends if for only because I think you will enjoy the book. Last year word got out that Johnny Depp would be bringing The People’s Act of Love to film, which seems both appropriate and daunting. Modern audiences can stomach just about anything, but a book that includes castration and cannibalization might be hard to translate with, er, taste. Nontheless, the book, which was longlisted for the Booker, has a cinematic flair and is well worth reading before the film is released, reportedly in 2009.
Primarily set in the remote Siberian village of Yazyk during the tumultuous years after the 1917 Russian revolution, “The People’s Act of Love” tells the calamitously converging stories of four people: One is Mutz, an officer in a Czech military unit  - led by a murderous sociopath - who is caught up in another country’s civil war. Mutz is long overdue for going home and well past believing in the means of his superior. The independent Anna Petrovna (incidentally, the name of a character in Chekhov’s first play, Platonov) is a mysteriously out of place woman whose purpose for living in the town is unknown except for one other person. And then there’s Balashov, leader of an Angelic religious sect who believes the only way to be close to God is to eschew all opportunities for fornication, that is, physically remove the possibility.
All of these characters live in a tense coexistence with their motivations veiled until Sarin arrives, literally walking in from upper Siberia with a man’s severed hand in his pocket. Sarin was a student who lost his youth and the woman he loved to revolution and has set out in the world to deliver the People, he believes, to the truth.  His arrival, which coincides with the death of a Shaman being held captive, is the catalyst for tensions to explode. The novel is built upon these characters and the collision of their individual philosophies.
James Meek, who’s written two other novels and was a foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union during the ‘90s, has researched this book well. He tells us in an afterward that many of the novel’s elements are a matter of historical yet widely unknown fact, which is interesting given their fantastical and violent nature. To tally the many heinous acts in “The People’s Act of Love”  - severed hands, toes, scrotum, thumbs, liver, etc. - would seem to me to miss the point, but it’s hard to resist as they add up and we begin to wonder if we’re not at a campfire listening to ghost stories. Closer to the point though, is the moral impetus behind these monstrous acts. It is a time of war and a time of revolution, a time when ugly terrible things become ordinary.
Meek poses questions through his characters: Is love a good reason to kill? Is there a difference between one who kills as a sociopath and one who kills for religion or patriotism, or love? “…Is there any cause which would justify a man butchering and eating his companion in the wilderness?” one character asks, adding, “who raises the companion for that purpose, like a farmer fattening a hog?” Does the question change when “the fate of the world rested” on this man, if he “is the will of the people. He’s the hundred thousand curses they utter every day against their enslavement.”? “To hold such a man,” he continues, “ to the same standards as ordinary men would be strange, like putting wolves on trial for killing elk…”
The other side of that questions is absolute pacifism and here idealistic brutality meets angelic, or perhaps stoic passivity. In this lovely passage, Balashov explains his journey toward God and a new life:</p>

And so goes the history of coffee: the people love it, the powerful want to control it or get a piece of the action.
Written by Nina Luttinger and Gregory Dicum, she a sustainable business consultant, he a writer, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1595580603%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1595580603%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002"><em>The Coffee Book</em></a> traces the common thread of “Kaveh,” as it was called during the days of the Ottoman Empire, from thousands of years ago to today as a politically charged drink and profitably exploitable trade. Readers will find little on the cover to indicate so, but The Coffee Book has a decided point of view. In describing the growing popularity of coffee in 20th century America, Luttinger and Dicum say…</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Indoors, away from the rhythm of the seasons, the new America increasingly moved to the rhythm of machines. Here, coffee was the ideal drink: it gave that kick you needed to spend sixteen hours tightening screws on a mind-numbing, dangerous factory floor or pounding away at a keyboard. Coffee has always been the perfect compliment to dehumanizing industrialization.&#8221;
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, there’s little sign of that impassioned reverence for the beverage often found in <a href="http://jimseven.com/?p=228" title="books">books</a> for coffee lovers. That’s because <em>The Coffee book</em> is not so much about coffee the drink, but coffee the bean, the powerful drug, profitable commodity and social elixir.
Yet there is passion here. In a world where we consumers are indeed away from “the rhythm of the seasons” and more specifically away from the origins of the products we buy, <em>The Coffee Book</em> is a whole-hearted attempt to connect us with an understanding of just how far those little beans travel before they make it into our mugs, often cultivated through the back-breaking toil of an underpaid worker equally disconnected from the end user of his labor’s produce, who may pay as much for one latte as he or she makes in a day.
Part of the problem is that coffee “cherries,” as they are called in their early stages, are grown in far away and often poorer countries. To get to our tummies in the form of a cup of joe they potentially travel through a network of growers, mills, intermediaries, government run marketing boards, exporters, importers or brokers, traders, roasters, distributors and then a cafe or other outlet. Most every player along the way takes a cut and each has some degree of pricing power that ultimately disfavors the farmer because the growing process takes a long time and is difficult to synchronize with market prices.
To complicate this scenario, there are various ways to cultivate coffee beans and in an attempt to meet marketing demand - to the tune of 15 billion pounds of green coffee per year - many growers have resorted to industrial scale plantations and “technification” methods, which produce higher yielding varieties that can be grown in the sun, but also result in a greater environmental impact. Traditional coffee farming is done on a small scale in a complex agrosystem dominated by shade trees and often with generational methods of controlling pests rather than environmentally harsh chemicals, which, because of the farm’s biodiversity, are not necessary.
The large industrial companies that control much of the world’s imports of coffee benefit from higher yielding methods and until recently a majority of consumers didn’t mind the trade-off in quality to keep the price of their daily drink low. Zoom forward to today’s affluent “artisanal” and activist buying culture and in steps the traditional farmer’s savior - maybe. 
Fair Trade certified coffee reaches you through fewer hands than before, often skipping such intermediaries as traders and distributors. Certification also guarantees that growers are paid a floor price for their produce as well as other stipulations such as worker-owned cooperatives and investment in social development. These expenses should be seen as investment in human capital at the least and if you’re inclined to think so, as a moral imperative for the difficult labor that goes into something we generally take for granted.
Fair Trade Coffee as something official has been in existence less than a decade, but thanks to a vociferous body of activist consumers, that and other sustainable methods are coming into the mainstream. Starbucks is now the largest roaster of Fair Trade coffee in the U.S., yet, as the book points out and I’ve noticed myself, it would seem there are more brochures about Fair Trade in their stores than the actual coffee. The mixed message here is a sign that this movement toward awareness and sustainable culture (I chose that phrase carefully) is only getting underway.
The hopeful byproduct of expecting and getting quality foodstuff must come with an awareness of where it comes from and at least partial responsibility for its continued existence. Admittedly, this attitude is new to me; <em>The Coffee Book</em> came at a particular point in my own awareness of these issues and has made a general tickle of thought into a more informed and actionable opinion.
I didn’t begin reading <em>The Coffee Book</em> on page one because that was the “history of” section populated, I figured, with quaint tales of trade routes and kings usually required in books of this ilk. I began on a later chapter and only when I saw <em>The Coffee Book’s</em> comprehensiveness and overarching goal did I read through the center, go back to the beginning and then finally read through the final chapters that brought all the history, political and industry talk into focus on today’s American market.
As is obvious by now, I am sympathetic to the views of the authors’. The book, as I said, has an opinion and not all readers will be comfortable with that. My education is in economics so you might say I’m a trained skeptic, so at times I wondered if I might benefit from a different perspective, although I’m not sure where exactly that would come from. And despite its point of view, the book is thorough enough that readers will feel as though the argument before them is thoughtful and has a higher aim than merely pointing fingers at the bad guys.
My only complaint about <em>The Coffee Book </em>is the lack of action asked of the reader. With a clear aim at elucidating the market powers that have driven mediocrity and exploitation in the coffee business, Luttinger and Dicum leave us with a hopeful picture of an industry moving toward bringing Fair Trade, Organic and Shade Grown coffees into the mainstream, yet don’t supply us with our way of being a part of the movement besides a few resources hidden away in the notes and bibliography.
So, I’ll offer a few places for you to start supporting Fair Trade:
<a href="http://www.transfairusa.org/" title="http://www.transfairusa.org/">TransFair USA</a> has a “shop” section to find local and online stores as well as a wealth of information on the subject.
<a href="http://www.gorillacoffee.com/" title="http://www.gorillacoffee.com/">Gorilla Coffee</a> is a Brooklyn micro-roaster who sells excellent Fair Trade coffee.
<a href="http://www.fairtraderesource.org/resources/index.html" title="http://www.fairtraderesource.org/resources/index.html">The Fair Trade Resource Network</a>
In addition to supporting small local companies that sell Free Trade coffee, you might also consider asking your Starbucks barista to brew you Fair Trade coffee too. As much as I like to support indies, the green mermaid seems unavoidable  - and is in fact the only source of Free Trade coffee in some countries - and to the extent you do shop there, continued pressure on the company to bring Fair Trade into the mainstream may have a greater impact than anything else.
I would be remiss in not mentioning in this line-up the excellent <a href="http://thenewpress.com/" title="The New Press">The New Press</a> who published this book. They are a not-for profit publisher putting out books in the public interest. I can’t imagine too many non-academic publishers putting out a book like this and I think it’s important to do so.</p>

Is there a new thing under the sun? &#8221;<br /> - Allen Ginsberg &#8220;Plutonian Ode&#8221;<br />
<br />
I recommend as a Soundtrack to Pynchon&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=159420120X%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/159420120X%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" title="Against the Day">&#8220;Against the Day,&#8221;</a> Philip Glass&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000BRF9T4%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000BRF9T4%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" title="Symphony No. 6, Plutonian Ode">Symphony No. 6 &#8220;Plutonian Ode&#8221;</a> with Allen Ginsberg. You&#8217;re thinking this is absurd - I know - to say a modern symphony connoting nuclear disaster can capture, musically, themes from a book that begins and ends before plutonium was discovered, but I say to you it&#8217;s striking how well the music fits with the book.
</p>
<p>
First, the word itself is a great play: &#8220;Plutonium&#8221; is of course a radioactive element discovered (named) in 1942 for the planet Pluto because plutonium follows neptuniam in the periodic table of elements just as the (erstwhile) planet Pluto orbits beyond Neptune in the solar system. &#8220;Plutonian,&#8221; the name of Ginsberg&#8217;s ode, refers to Pluto, God of the world of the dead, deep within the earth, infernal, dismal. Get it? The two are intertwined in the Ode and most certainly in real life - Plutonian comes up in <i>Against the Day</i> on page 154 in context of the &#8220;DOLEFUL&#8221; metropolis (NYC?) where &#8220;Fire and blood were about to roll like fate upon the complacent multitudes...&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Besides the mood evoked by the title - and I haven&#8217;t finished the book yet - I do feel as though much of the scientific discussion in <em>Against the Day</em> premeditates the Atomic age and the hold it has on our lives.
</p>
<p>
The music itself has a grandeur - you may know Philip Glass scores a lot of films - that befits an epic like Pynchon&#8217;s and its grandeur, it seems, is self-mocking in such a way to belie the seriousness of its underlying themes.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m not, by the way, suggesting that you sit down with the music while you read the book - you&#8217;d get nowhere with either. The symphony - particularly the version with the Ginsberg reading that Glass superimposed over the music with Lauren Flanigan singing the very same libretto (poem) - stands on its own. But I often think about music and books or art forms that in their specific details relate to one another, throwing a different light on your thinking about them or expressing the story in a different way. I think the <em>Plutonian Ode</em> does that.

		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2006/08/29/laird-hunt-s-the-exquisite/" title="<p>!{float:left;margin-right:18px}http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1566891876.01.<em>SCMZZZZZZZ</em>.jpg(altimage)! If you liked Charlie Kaufman’s “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” or Alejandro Amenábar’s “Open Your Eyes (remade as Vanilla Sky), then I’d bet you’ll like Laird Hunt’s latest novel <em>The Exquisite</em>. I know I’m getting off cheap by putting a novel in a category with a couple of films, but those two exceptional movies came to mind when reading the book. Like those films, <em>The Exquisite</em> is a quirky ‘don’t-know-exactly-where-reality-begins-and-ends’ type of story, which is quite appealing to a mindset that’s open to the “improbable,” as Hunt aptly characterizes his book.
I knew I would like <em>The Exquisite</em> when I saw the epigraph quoting Fernando Pessoa’s The Book of Disquiet: ”<em>I fainted during a bit of my life. I regain consciousness without any memory of what I was, and the memory of who I was suffers for having been interrupted. There is in me a confused notion of an unknown interval, a futile effort on the part of my memory to want to find that other memory. I don’t connect myself with myself. If I’ve lived, I forget having known it.</em>” Epigraphs often mean more to the author than to the reader, but once you’ve read <em>The Exquisite</em> you realize just how well this quote fits, so much so that you can imagine the narrator speaking those words himself. “Once upon a time I was someone then that stopped,” he begins.
Henry, our unlikable unreliable narrator lives in the East Village in New York City. He’s something of a ne’er-do-well who slips into a seedy existence after his girlfriend leaves him and he falls in with an odd gang of fake murderers. Now, when I say fake murderers I may mean that they did fake murders, or they were fake murderers, or their fake murders were fake, or something like that, but I’ll leave that for you to decide when you read the book. Much of the story centers around one of those fake murderers whose murder doesn’t seem to be so fake, who happens to be the namesake of a petty thief immortalized - maybe literally - in the Rembrandt painting <em>The Anatomy Lesson</em> as the subject of a public dissection.
Aris Kindt, this namesake of the man dissected for posterity, enters Henry’s life with a tinge of risk and eroticism that he finds at once perplexing and comfortable:
bq. “It was this deep enjoyment of orchestrated experiences in which pain and pleasure lay tightly coiled that had prompted Mr. Kindt, I presumed, to take out a membership at the Eleventh Street Russian baths, a venerable mobster-frequented establishment where what I took to be blast furnaces filled with boiling, beet-red lumps of flesh coexisted with sinister massage cabinets and a deep icy pool…It was Mr. Kindt’s rule, one that Tulip and I were both happy to comply with, that if we came with him we did all of it. So it was that, to my surprising delight, I had a huge guy sit on my back, soap me up, whack me with oak branches, and time and again pour near-frozen water on me…”
When we meet Mr. Kindt, he is sitting in the dark, naked, strapped to a heart monitor as Henry is burglarizing him. He doesn’t get any less strange as the story goes on, not in any of his incarnations, and neither do any of his equally odd colleagues, all of whom seem to have stepped out of a Quentin Tarantino movie (this is my last movie mention, I swear); like Cornelius, who wears a hunting cape, or the “contortionist twins,” or Tulip the beautiful tattoo artist, and finally a bartender enigmatically named Job  - I imagine after Job in the Bible or perhaps of the Robert Heinlein book, <em>Job: a Comedy of Justice</em>, or maybe just job, like an act of crime - who also seems to appear with different names.
In fact, many people show up with different names or as different people in <em>The Exquisite</em>. The main thread of the book consists of Henry’s hospital experience where he chronicles the time that makes up the rest of the book - the events, we find, that have led him there - and generally hallucinates (maybe hallucinates) a set of characters who parallel others in the other story. It’s not as confusing as I make it sound, not, that is, if you don’t try too hard to make sense of it.
I don’t believe Hunt ever used the word exquisite in the text, but the title is a well earned compliment as the book is indeed “ingeniously devised” as the name suggests and Hunts writing fits the bill as well. I was struck - this is a small but telling thing - by his use of the word “truffle” as a verb at the end of the book in the acknowledgment section (which section, by the way, holds a key to the story that is alluded to about half-way through, but cryptically). By all accounts truffle is a noun - suggesting to me Hunt’s joie des mots and playfulness with language. It’s clear that Hunt likes to explore the various meanings a word can take on, just like the names people take or the way they change themselves with or without their clothes or tattoos etched into their skin. This manifests itself in words like the aforementioned “Job” or “swell” or “fleck” that he uses repeatedly, or the way he channels meaning with things like fish (as a friend, a food, a subject of a dream and a symbol) and cigars - Kindt smokes Dutch Masters (think Rembrandt).
Any complaints I have are trifling compared to the overall experience here, but Hunt seems to have had a few set-pieces on New York City in his head that felt slightly out of place as I read, and there is a seemingly obligatory or compulsive placement of a 9/11 placemark that seemed to me to have little purpose. Ultimately though, <em>The Exquisite</em> is full of deliciously bad characters (Aunt Lulu, who might have been a cat murderer, is a particular favorite) rich allusions and an uncertain reality that, if you’re comfortable with that sort of thing, is a lot of fun.

[UPDATE: Unfortunately, I'm told that Lenox Hill Books is closing its doors]
</p>
<p>
As I roam around New York City I mark areas by their restaurants and bookstores and thats how I think of them. It's amazing that while B&#038;N and Amazon seem to dominate the landscape we have so many great independent bookstores. I don't know if they're thriving, but while some have closed others have opened.
</p>
<p>
It's been a while since I looked at my list of New York City independent bookstores and that exercise is long overdue. Today I updated McNally Robinson, which I put back in the 4th spot, tied in my view with St. Marks. I'll be revisiting some of my commentary here and adding Brooklyn stores too, some of which I've grown fond of in my short time in the Borough of Kings.
</p>
<p>
See also the comments section of a post at <a href="http://metaxucafe.com/cafe/content/article/call_to_members_post_your_favorite_bookstore/">MetaxuCafe</a> for some other great bookstores.

<br />16 East 46th Street (btwn 5th/Madison)
<br />212 719-4448
</p>
<p>
Simply the best bookstore in the city. Personal service, a rich history and a deep collection of serious literature. Both new and used books, including classics, poetry (probably the best in the city), many author-specific collections. The ultimate in browsing, even if the location is too midtowney to suggest from the outside that it has character. Gotham used to be the only place you needed to go to find literary journals. Since their recent move one block away - but seemingly a million miles from their old location - their journal collection has thinned. Hopefully that will change as they get settled in. See my previous <a href="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/08/wise_men_have_f.html" target="_blank" title="article on Gotham Book Mart">article</a> on Gotham for more information.

<p>
<strong><a href="http://threelives.com/">Three Lives &#038; Company</a></strong>
<br />154 West 10th Street (at Waverly Place)
<br />212-741-2069
</p>
<p>
Named in part for a Gertrude Stein book, Three Lives is a bookstore's bookstore. It really is a perfectly beautiful store. The owner has excellent taste and you can always find something interesting and new from some small presses as well as the majors. There are no used books here, so don't go looking for any bargains. Most but not all of the books at Three Lives are trade paperbacks. The poetry section is smallish, but there is a travel section, a New York section, staff picks and a selection of books on writing. The store hosts readings by popular authors, information about which you can find on their web-site. (p.s. Don't go to Three Lives without stopping by Joe, The Art of Coffee, for a near perfect ristretto espresso. Joe is around the block at the corner of Waverly and Gay.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mercer Street Books</strong>
<br />206 Mercer St. (at Bleeker)
<br />212 505-8615
</p>
<p>
This is one of my favorite used bookstores. They have a solid selection of fiction in hard and paper-back, literary criticism, classics and poetry. It's proximity to New York University is probably responsible for its good selection of criticism and other serious stuff; be sure to check out the recent arrivals table. They also have a selection of old literary journals, which are fun (if such things fit your idea of fun) to pick through randomly.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.mcnallyrobinsonnyc.com/">McNally Robinson</a></strong>
<br />50 Prince St. (between Lafayette and Mulberry)
<br />(212)274-1160
</p>
<p>
McNally Robinson is related to but independent of the Canadian company of the same name. It's great to see new bookstores opening and McNally Robinson appeared just last December in neighborhood nowadays called Nolita. They have pretty a active event calendar and a &#8220;tea house.&#8221; They have a small selection of literary journals, and a decent emphasis on good literature for a general bookstore. In fact, they have a &#8220;local poets&#8221; section set aside (of course this is New York City, so that could, practically speaking, be quite large, but it isn't. They also arrange their fiction into regions, which is unique and welcome. The selection is not huge, but appears to be thoughtful.
</p>
<p>
Update: I had previously reported that McNally Robinson had shrunk their literary selection, but after speaking to the folks there, I am assured that the space has grown, so I've retracted my earlier comment.
</p>
<p>
From Mcnally Robinson's buyer: &#8220;...the shelf space devoted to Lit has only grown since we opened...Literature happens to be squeezed into a physically tighter area in the more valuable upstairs real estate, but there are more books on the shelf than before. Initially I didn't believe it either.  Then I got a tape measure out. Interesting how we humans perceive space.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.stmarksbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp">St. Marks Bookshop</a></strong>
<br />31 Third Ave. (at E. 9th)
<br />212 260-7853
</p>
<p>
Fairly mainstream bookstore, but St. Marks does have a good selection of literature/culture and art books that to some degree reflect the neighborhood. Probably the second best place, behind Gotham, for literary journals. The poetry and fiction sections are by no means comprehensive, but well chosen. There are no used books here. (p.s. If you go to St. Marks, you must stop by the Mud truck at the Astor Place subway for one of the best cups of coffee in the city.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.housingworks.org/usedbookcafe/index.html">Housing Works Used Book Cafe</a></strong>
<br />126 Crosby Street (at Houston)
<br />212 334-3324
</p>
<p>
The UBC is a great store for browsing and finding bargains. You can find a book and relax in the cafe. The environment is warm, the building is classic and there's a pretty wide selection of literature, always very cheap. Also, your money is well spent here, because 100% of the profits go to Housing Works, a non-profit organization that provides housing, healthcare, job training, advocacy and many other services for homeless New Yorkers living with HIV and Aids. That alone is worth doing some shopping there. They are having a sale this weekend (Jan 8/9) too, when everything is 30% off.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.strandbooks.com/home/">The Strand Annex</a></strong>
<br />95 Fulton Street (3 blocks east of Broadway)
<br />212 732-6070
</p>
<p>
The Annex is much better for browsing than its parent. A fairly deep used fiction selection (a lot of hardbacks) and much more space between the shelves to maneuver (the main Strand store can get very cramped and crowded).

</p>
<p>
Described as a store of scholarly, literary &#038; cultural books, Labyrinth serves the Columbia U. smarties. This bookstore has an amazing literature collection, including poetry, but major authors only. You will sometimes find what you are looking for discounted 25%, but don't count on it. The real bargains are at the <a href="http://www.labyrinthbooks.com//main.asp?">sale annex</a>, which is only on-line, but where the prices tend to hover around $5-6. Some of the books from the annex, however, do find their way to Labyrinth's staircase even though that inventory doesn't seem to change much.

18 Miles of Books. Overated, but probably the best place to sell your used books. Great for browsing and with enough effort you may find some bargains, but there are tons of (only) slightly discounted books. The Strand does have one specialty that is unparalleled as far as I know and that is their reviewer's copy section, tucked away in the basement. These are all new and recently published books at 1/2 off of their original price. Don't expect to find anything hot there though.
</p>
<p>
The Strand also has a kiosk at 5th Ave and 60th for a quick fix on your way to Cipriani's for a $19 glass of scotch.

A smallish all used bookstore with a mixture of hard and paper-backs and a variety of subjects. Never a first stop, but worth a drop by if you're at the Strand (which is close by).

Murder Ink claims to carry every mystery book in print and I think that speaks for itself. Next door, Ivy carries a mixture of new and used literature. It's a small, quaint, homey shop (I think it was in the Visa ad with Kevin Bacon) that is always worth a stop.

Okay, so the name is not too creative, but it's a pleasant stop with a small but well chosen selection of literature and non-fiction and an art space. There are bargains to be had on a small cart toward the front, but most of the inventory consists of new paperbacks. The bookstore serves at the pleasure of its owners who also own an art gallery nearby, choose the books and set up the impressive readings the store hosts.

Yeah, so it's on the Upper East Side. It's still a nice bookstore. Very Pleasant with a selection of the latest editions in literature and general non-fiction. Pretty mainstream stuff for the most part, but they have started their own &#8220;Chapbook Series&#8221; publishing and a &#8220;First Editions Club&#8221; if that's your sort of thing. I consider myself a reader, not a collector, but I do like to see bookshop owners venturing out and doing interesting things.

Ah, another Upper East Sider. Whenever I brush off my passport to go to that side of town I try to stop by Crawford Doyle. It's small and sells mostly new paperbacks and general non-fiction, but they do have an interesting collection of rare books to look at. It's always fun for an occasional browse.

Coliseum is overrated. They seem to be trying to be all things to all people. Now they have a cafe and a not terribly helpful staff. The selection is spotty (my impression is that it was better before they moved to their new location) and doesn't seem to be too serious anywhere. i.e. I never find myself saying...&#8220;I'm looking for X book, maybe I should stop at Coliseum first.&#8221;

Posman used to be a good bookstore. They used to be right next to NYU and carried textbooks and an interesting selection of some serious stuff that you might not find elsewhere. Now they are very general, they sell a lot of paperbacks and serve GCT commuters, not book lovers.

<strong>Westsider Used &#038; Rare</strong>
<br />2246 Broadway (at 80th)
<br />212 362-0706
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few opportunities to buy used books around the Upper West Side. There are a lot of books being sold on tables on the street and there are little bookstores tucked away where you wouldn't know they are there, such as Gryphon Bookshop. One of them (the name escapes me) finally gave up and closed its dusty doors, but there are still others fighting the good fight. Westsider is one of them. Books stacked to its very tall ceiling (it has a loft, so the main floor is two stories), it's a fun place to pop into once in a while. As with most used bookstores, you never know what you will find. Unfortunately, the fiction section seems to be all paperbacks, which are not appealing to me because they've already used a good part of their limited life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Biases:</strong>
</p>
<p>
This list is not meant to be a comprehensive list of stores. Here are my biases:
</p>
<p>
First, these are only Manhattan shops, where, for the moment, I hang my hat and therefore buy my books. There are great bookstores that I know about in Brooklyn and upstate New York and the Berkshires, but then things start to get out of hand.
</p>
<p>
This list is mostly concerned with literature and not special interests. In NYC there are bookstores that sell nothing but cookbooks, there are gay bookstores like the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore, there are travel bookstores, like the Complete Traveller (with an amazing used and rare travel book collection), stores that specialize in rare collectible books like Bauman's or Argosy, children's bookstores like Books of Wonder, art bookstores, and so on. Again, things would get out of hand if I were to try and write about all of them, and literature is my only interest in terms of the pastime of browsing for and buying books. I've also only listed independent stores here because no one needs me to tell them about Barnes &#038; Noble (although they do have a good annex on 18th st, their original store I think, where they have text books and such).
</p>
<p>
My last bias is that I really really like to find cheap used hardcover books; they last longer and tend not to have reader annotations (which I avidly add myself). I buy fiction, criticism and poetry. These stores are the places I go to find those things. If you know of a place worth checking out, I'd love to hear about it.

If he has the means he buys a sports car or a boat, or if he's Harry Mathews he becomes a spy for CIA.
</p>
<p>
Well, not really a spy; he pretended. He pretended to be a spy because circumstances opened themselves to it and he was an adventurous, creative guy who also happened to be a little bored.
</p>
<p>
The setting for My Life in CIA (those in the know don't use &#8220;the&#8221; in front of CIA, we learn) is Paris, France over the course of 1973. Harry Mathews is a divorced, well-to-do 43 year old man of the 70s - &#8220;snug black velvet bellbottoms&#8221; and all  - whose cocktail party friends suspect as being a spy. Every denial becomes a confirmation in their eyes so he decides to indulge and ride the intrigue for whatever mischievous fun he can find. Here's an example:
</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;The following Monday I started passing the Saint Germain <em>without</em> going in. I carried a briefcase and walked briskly west down Boulevard Saint-Germain. On the corner of Rue Saint-Simon I stopped in the recessed doorway of a bookstore and looked back. No sign of my mark, not the first morning or the next; the third he was there. I led him by a devious route - Rues de Bellechasse, Varenne, Bourgogne, Las-Cases - to the church of Sainte Clothilde. I walked slowly and expectantly round the little park in front of the church. Then I hurried home a quite different way. I made sure I never lost my tail.
<br />
<br />That afternoon I took the metro to Saint Augustin on the right bank. I got straight into a taxi that deposited me, back on the other side of town, near an Avis garage in the fifteenth arrondissement. I rented their cheapest model, a Peugeot 204. For half an hour I had fun practicing &#8221;evasive driving techniques&#8220; before heading for Sainte Clothilde. I pulled into the first space that opened up on the park side of Rue Marignan. Before leaving I cracked the rear window next to the sidewalk, left the same door unlocked, and pasted a two-inch strip of Scotch tape over its lower edge.&#8221;
</blockquote>
<p>
Most I think, might be unnerved and stop the game after being followed by a stranger, but of course most people probably wouldn't pretend to be a spy. If a little Sunday cloak and dagger were not enough, Mathews goes so far as to create a company to act as cover and go out in the world laying a trail of open questions for the &#8220;real&#8221; spies to find. And find him they do.
</p>
<p>
As the tall tale grows, Matthews meets a cast of mysterious strangers - the tantric lover, Marie-Claude Quintelpreux - &#8220;...release the demons in you that molest pure yearning!&#8221; Or, Florence, who is forty inches tall and &#8220;perfect in every limb,&#8221; who saves Mathew's life in the obligatory foot-sex-with-a-midget-in-a-church-after-being-hosted-to-drinks-and-dancing-with-Zendor-an evildoer-whose-house-you-find-yourself-in-after-being-whisked-away-naked-in-an-exotic-rug scene.
</p>
<p>
There are also some true spies, opportunists, ruffians, beautiful women, communists and assassins who either don't know what to make of our hero, want something they think he's got, or want him out of the way; permanently. Through his odd encounters, we glimpse along with Mathews a world beyond the cocktail party chatter and intellectual ideas where he came from into a world of concrete action and cause-and-effect - as in, these people mean business. Mathews finds himself not so much deeply involved in the game of spying as in the brutality of staying alive.
</p>
<p>
As enjoyable as the Mathews' story is, I think that it also illuminates elements of the absurd character that geopolitics can take on, and how we all, playing our small roles, are taken in by it, sometimes forgetting that the consequences are often harsh. Mathews also captures a nervousness among some of his elite friends and others he encounters that might be as good as any snapshot of 1973. In one scene, Mathews speaks to a group of communists about his made-up geopolitical views but all they care to hear about is Watergate, a subject about which they seem hopelessly naive. It is not until he meets people in the country - far removed from the social and political scene - that the frenetic life he (momentarily) left behind can be seen for what it is.
</p>
<p>
I read My Life in CIA one afternoon over the summer. Fitting for the season, I'd say, because it's fast paced, fun and something of a farce. If you're one of those habitual daydreamers like me, you'll enjoy Mathews' winking Graham Greenesque account of playing spy and even if you're not, you'll enjoy his crafty story telling and the occasional reference to velvet clothes and a few other '70s artifacts.

		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2005/07/14/jane-a-murder-by-maggie-nelson/" title="<p>
I almost didn't pick up Maggie Nelson's book <em>Jane {a murder}</em>. The title and the photo on the cover said to me &#8220;this is not a book for you.&#8221; Looking at the back cover, phrases like &#8220;dark, female masterpiece,&#8221; &#8220;true story of a murder&#8221; and &#8220;blurred-genre memoir&#8221; all confirmed that this was a book to put on the bottom of the burgeoning stack. Somewhere inside of me though, I like to think there exists a sixth sense, a nagging intuition about good books that made me pick up <em>Jane</em> just to read a page or two. I didn't put it down again.
</p>
<p>
<em>Jane {a murder}</em> is a classified as a book of poetry and a book of true crime. It is all things described, but none of those capture its singular purpose and its classification doesn't matter when you read it. It's a story well told of a woman brutally killed and another woman yearning to know more about the ever present shade of her murdered aunt. Jane was murdered in 1969 while a student at the University of Michigan. Four years later, Jane's sister had a daughter who knew about her aunt, but never quite enough and certainly never about the night she was shot, which was just one in a series of media-sensationalized killings dubbed the &#8220;Michigan Murders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As an antidote to that sensationalism, Nelson explores Jane's life and death with a poet's sensibility through anecdotes, clippings and diary entries. Her skill as a poet is matched by the way she weaves these various elements together as a deft storyteller. In fact, the diary entries, which were written years before her murder are not all in chronological order, but seamlessly placed in the order, perhaps, of Maggie Nelson's emotional discovery.
</p>
<p>
These two passages sit on facing pages. The first is Jane's diary entry from 1966, around the age of twenty, three years before her death:
</p>
<blockquote>
Careless dribble - again
<br />
<br />Strange, lying in bed
<br />unable to sleep
<br />
<br />That's all familiar
<br />but the thoughts inside of me
<br />are not
<br />
<br />Questions, over and over
<br />home too long, back too soon
<br />
<br />alone, really alone
<br />
<br />What are you like when you're alone
<br />
<br />ugly, heavy, disreputable
<br />unsure, awake, useless
<br />
<br />This room is hideous
</blockquote>
<p>
The next page, titled &#8220;Hideous&#8221;, comes after Ms. Nelson has maybe come to know too much about Jane's murder:
</p>
<blockquote>
Unable to sleep, surrounded by
<br />her words. Afraid, truly afraid
<br />
<br />to tell you about my brain
<br />chattering with cruelties-
<br />
<br />When did she know
<br />she was in danger;
<br />
<br />the terrible little gun
<br />flat against her head;
<br />
<br /><em>which shot first,
<br />the front or the back?
<br /></em>
<br />The fear,
<br />her fear
<br />
<br />but I cannot imagine that.
<br />
<br /><em>Why keep trying?</em>
<br />I can hear you say. Well
<br />
<br />I can't help it. I just do. Then
<br />to stop the thoughts, I imagine
<br />
<br />two quick, dull shots
<br />that come as a sort of relief. Don't you know,
<br />
<br />I recognize this
<br />as hell.
<br />
<br />I try to use the tricks I've learned to get through this-
<br />
<br /><em>Meditate on a wrathful deity.
<br />Watch it melt into light.
<br /></em>
<br />And so I do, and find
<br />that not even Kali
<br />
<br />with her mouth full of blood
<br />non Thor with his hammer
<br />
<br />can take me away from here, where
<br />your breath spouts out of you
<br />
<br />and I listen.
</blockquote>
<p>
Ms. Nelson took some license with Jane's diary entries, at the least creating line-breaks, but she uses them to such great affect that they become Jane's cries. What under normal circumstances are fairly typical reflections on youthful angst and self-doubt - &#8220;right now I hate my sister so...I am jealous of Barb's fun, dates, looks, assurance...&#8221; - become here the private truths of a woman denied her life before she had a chance to work them out - &#8220;This kid doesn't know anything. / She'd like to sleep the childish slumber of a baby and yet live in a world of complexities.&#8221; -  through them we come closer to understanding her tragedy, not so much through pathos but empathy.
</p>
<p>
What makes the difference between pathos and empathy is restraint. That is a strength in this book. Halfway through we are led to the murder scene, the press and investigation, meditations on blood -  &#8220;Can anyone like blood the way one likes the mountain or the sea&#8221; - the freaks that call Jane's grieving parents - &#8220;<em>Where's Jane, boo-hoo-hoo</em>&#8221; - and other detritus left in the wake of a brutal murder, like the psychic brought in to solve the case of the serial killer - &#8220;<em>Her face was beat, beat, beat. It was wrinkled like a monkey's</em>.&#8221; But before she takes us too far down the path of &#8220;true-crime,&#8221; just when we start to feel like voyeurs getting too close, Nelson puts down the looking-glass and stops to breath - &#8220;Somehow I need to make it clear: none of these details belongs to me.&#8221; By then though, like stumbling across a dead body, we can't forget what we've seen - &#8220;the imaginary is what tends / to become real, and when it does / there's no paint black enough / to cover it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
In the beginning of the book, Nelson imagines the final moments of Jane's life:
</p>
<blockquote>
She had been shot once in the front and once in the back of the head. She wandered, trying to find someone to remove the slugs from her skull. She was not dead yet, but she feared she was dying.The holes in her head were perfectly round and bloodless, with burnt-flared edges, two eclipses. The passage of air through the holes felt peculiar, just dimly painful, like chewing hot or cold food on a cavity, the sensation of space where it had once been dense and full.
<br />
<br />Sunlight shot around the circumference of each black rind, so that a long shaft of pale light cast out from the center of her forehead, and another shaft streamed behind her.
<br />
<br /><em>Is this the light of the mind? Is this the light of </em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>my</em></span><em> mind?</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
This would be an easy passage to overdo, but I think it's great. It tells us right in the beginning that the author has put herself as nearly as she can imagine into the shoes of Jane. And although Jane's parents don't figure prominently in the book, this piece, where she says &#8220;the sensation of space where it had once been dense and full&#8221; signifies their loss, the void where there was once a life.
</p>
<p>
<em>Jane</em> works so well because the poetry itself is nearly invisible. So much contemporary poetry tends to be too self-conscious to let its meaning work on you, but Maggie Nelson's poems manage to both fluidly pull us through the story and stand alone  - they are purposeful and poignant with no pretense. Indeed, I would classify <em>Jane {a murder}</em> as a page-turner.

"&gt;Jane {a murder}, by Maggie Nelson

		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2005/07/11/we-re-all-a-little-mad-final-thoughts-on-don-quixote/" title="<p>
Ernest Hemingway said &#8220;All good books have one thing in common - they are truer than if they had really happened, and after you have read one of them you will feel that all that happened, happened to you and then it belongs to you forever.&#8221;
<br />
</p>
<p>
I think Pappa stole that idea from Cervantes. Who better knew how literature seeps into our consciousness just as much as we let it? Who more than Don Quixote lived through the books he read, defended the honor of made up characters and, when becoming one of those characters himself championed the unseen author of his own history?
<br />
</p>
<p>
When I wrote a piece called &#8220;<a href="http://www.400windmills.com/2005/04/why_read_don_qu.html">Why Read Don Quixote?</a>&#8221; just before starting the book, I wondered if I would finish, or enjoy it or if in the end it would mean anything to me. I admitted then that I had started once and put it down. I said too in that piece that reading the <em>Quixote</em> was the result &#8220;of a seemingly inevitable collision with the book through others I&#8217;ve read.&#8221; I had no idea that <em>Don Quixote</em> is, in many ways, all about that collision. Our ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha was a great lover of books. Not only did he read a lot, his erudition amazed everyone he met, even as they puzzled over his madness. He retained so much that his books became collectively his Bible in the way that many look to theirs as a manual on how to live. But for Quixote, the <em>Gospel according to John</em> was instead maybe the Gospel according to Amad&#237;s of Gaul.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Like the parting of the Red Sea, Don Quixote&#8217;s &#8220;history&#8221; was born from the very idea that the romances he read were indeed &#8220;truer than if they had really happened.&#8221; That trueness, Don Quixote&#8217;s reality, is the most fascinating element of the story. His sanity always lay just below the surface in the same but opposite way that most of us have a little madness just below our social veneer.
<br />
</p>
<p>
I was struck around mid-way through when a boy whom Don Quixote had &#8220;saved&#8221; from a beating by his master, revealed that because of Don Quixote&#8217;s actions he was beaten even more. Quixote&#8217;s remorse was painful and I felt as though he would have passed through his sanity divide and stayed there, but ultimately he couldn&#8217;t help himself and continued on his travels. That sort of thing was a constant source of frustration and tension throughout the book. He never seemed to learn from all that happened until finally he was vanquished himself, which wasn&#8217;t just a matter of valor, but faith. When Don Quixote stopped believing in the literature, he stopped believing in himself and he died.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Right from the prologue we know that the book <em>Don Quixote</em> is about language and literature as Cervantes criticizes the methods of his peers and forebears. There are stories within the story and most every character at some point becomes someone who they are not in everyday life - everyone is a storyteller and everyone straddles the line of believing in their tales.
<br />
</p>
<p>
In terms of language, Sancho is constantly harangued by Don Quixote for his poor use of proverbs and incessant malapropisms. Interestingly, Quixote&#8217;s intolerance for poor language and circumlocution is usually met by the public&#8217;s vulgar tastes. For example, the Duke and Duchess love Sancho&#8217;s witless witticisms and always insist he keep talking despite Quixote&#8217;s protests. So while Quixote chastises Sancho, everyone else is amused and only wants to hear more, which seems to be the very same problem that Cervantes has in stamping out the romance literature of old.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Our text, putting aside for a moment that it is a translation from the Spanish, is, we are told, a translation from events that transpired in Spanish dialogue into Arabic by Cide Hamete Benengeli, which is then translated back to Spanish for the benefit of our narrator. This naturally was an area of exploration for speakers on the <a href="http://www.400windmills.com/2005/04/pen_world_voice.html">Global Quixote translator&#8217;s panel</a>. There are a lot of errors in the book and no one knows if they were intentional or not, although some suspect they were, and that becomes just one aspect of the translation. Additionally, most agree that Cervantes&#8217; wordplay is often central to enjoying the book and extracting meaning from the dialogue. I recommend Edith Grossman&#8217;s translation to anyone who thinks those elements are essential. I thought Grossman&#8217;s spare footnotes terrifically enlightened me when Cervantes used meanings that through time or translation would be lost. I imagine there are many more examples that a scholarly edition would include, but her judgement produced a balanced, readable and enjoyable novel. Given the layers of translation, a non-Spanish reader must recognize their translator as just as much a part of the book as Hamete or Cervantes himself.

Now that <em>Don Quixote</em> has sat snugly on the shelf for a couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve practically forgotten some of my earlier misgivings (that I wrote <a href="http://www.400windmills.com/2005/04/the_knight_of_t.html">about</a>). I see now why this novel is loved by so many great writers and I think the Hemingway quote says it all. I like to think, like Don Quixote or like Fabrizio in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0679783180%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0679783180%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" id="2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0679783180%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">The Charterhouse of Parma</a></em> - who was impelled to set out into the world by reading about Napoleon - that I too live richer having seen the world through the lives of my imaginary heros. <em>Don Quixote</em> is a testament to reading and a testament to believing in the imagination, even if the outside world doesn&#8217;t always get it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
I remember the novel <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0446673382%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0446673382%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" id="2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0446673382%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">A Mapmaker&#8217;s Dream</a></em>, where a hermetic cartographer draws maps of the world based solely upon the exotic tales of travelers. Fra Mauro, the mapmaker, says:
<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>
...I believed that the thoughts and impressions of all my visitors were derived from a certain actuality, at all times palpable, when in truth their remarks had quite obviously passed through the filter of their own sensibility.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />What that belief really means is that my map is a distortion. All its representation of terrain and oceans is but the revelation of how I regarded my visitors&#8217; perceptions in the first place. I now realize that the world is not real save in the way each of us impresses upon it his own sensibility. More importantly, this sensibility results from a belief in the world being a measurable whole, rather than something that extends beyond time or place.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Yet I am grateful to those who have provided me with the benefit of their illusions. They have journeyed to Venice, to this monastery, from so many distant places in order to share with me the purest of all deceptions - that of their own willingness to be entranced.
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In a way, we all have that, we are all a little crazy because we are willing to be entranced, and so was most every character in Don Quixote. I think that one thing that people miss when talking about this book is just how great every single character is. Besides maybe <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> or <em>Hamlet</em>, I can&#8217;t think of another book that makes every single character integral to the story. It&#8217;s that wholeness that gives it life and makes it so true.
<br />
</p>
<p>
For anyone who has only read the first part of Don Quixote, I say read the second. In some way that I can&#8217;t identify, particularly since they were published ten years apart, the second half completes and defines the novel as a whole and makes it so much more meaningful. <em>Vale</em>.

**SPOILERS ALERT (I&#8217;ll try not to reveal much, but there may be spoilers here)**
<br />
</p>
<p>
As I close in with less than a quarter of the book remaining, I thought it worthwhile to collect randomly a few observations I&#8217;ve had on the second half - or third sally - of Don Quixote&#8217;s journey. Book two feels radically different than book one as the reception Our Ingenious Gentleman and his squire receive is far more peaceful than before. There is less violence and what little there is has tended to favor Quixote rather than harm him (for example the joust with the Knight of the Mirrors). The Knight of the Mirrors is an apt name, I think, because in part two there are many people disguising themselves in one way or another, such as the Knight of the Mirrors himself; Pedro who has reappeared from book one; Basilio&#8217;s death, which is the third mock suicide by blade for the sake of a love in the book as a whole, with the others being Luscinda and Camila; there is the enchanted Dulcinea, although she is only disguised by Sancho&#8217;s guile; and lastly, the Duke and Duchess, who are only in disguise in so far as their sincerity is concerned.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Sancho Panza is becoming something of a caricature of himself in book two - his subtle observations from part one have given way to strings of barely relevant proverbs and self-serving proclamations. I had long thought that the quote &#8220;there are but two families in this world, the haves and the have-nots&#8221; was attributed to Don Quixote, but on page 594 I found that line streaming from Sancho&#8217;s mouth as he reverses his loyalty to someone because they are rich and therefore have food for him:
<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>
And he showed him the pot full of geese and chickens, and seizing one of them, he began to eat with great verve and enthusiasm, saying:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;To hell with Basilio&#8217;s talents! You&#8217;re worth what you have, and what you have is what you&#8217;re worth. There are only two lineages in the world, as my grandmother used to say, and that&#8217;s the haves and the have-nots, though she was on the side of having; nowadays, Se&#241;or Don Quixote, wealth is better than wisdom: an ass covered in gold seems better than a saddled horse. And so I say again that I&#8217;m on the side of Camacho, whose pots are overflowing with geese and chickens, hares and rabbits, while Basilio&#8217;s, if they ever show up, and even if they don&#8217;t, won&#8217;t hold anything but watered wine.&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Sancho&#8217;s boldness has grown with his skepticism, which instead of showing any sense of perspicacity instead has made him seem more simpleminded. It&#8217;s confusing in a way, as both Sancho and Don Quixote have an awareness of Quixote&#8217;s madness and what is looking more and more like Sancho&#8217;s madness, but they refuse to accept any one else&#8217;s recognition of it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
The emphasis on language is also interesting here and more prominant in book two. Sancho&#8217;s bold pronouncements are usually countered by his malaprops. Malapropism is a term used to describe a person&#8217;s use of a (typically polysyllabic) word incorrectly, primarily with the effect of contradicting themselves or making them look foolish or comical. The word was coined from Mrs. Malaprop in an 18th century play called <em>The Rivals</em> by Richard Brinsley Sheridan. My handy dictionary of literary terms credits Shakespeare as using them (not called malaprops) in <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>, but I would say that Sancho&#8217;s malaprops are a prime example too.
<br />
</p>
<p>
James Wood in his essay on Don Quixote in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0374177376%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0374177376%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" class="floatimgleft" id="2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0374177376%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">The Irresponsible Self</a></em>, says that &#8220;A rough analogy of the action in the second book might go like this: Jesus Christ is wandering around first-century Palestine trying to convince people that he is the true Messiah.&#8221; That seems to me as though (and Wood does address this in a more thoughtful way) the New Testament had been written before Christ&#8217;s journey and he was only forming part two. I bring this up mostly because of the religious aspects I&#8217;ve noticed in part two. Of course, religion is a theme throughout the book because religious life and religious delineations were a significant part of life then and a part of the racial landscape. But I&#8217;m thinking more of personal terms, where for example, Sancho performs a catechism of sorts on page 515. Quixote uses biblical language to describe his journey on page 495:
<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;I know that the path of virtue is very narrow and the road of wickedness is broad and spacious; I know that their endings and conclusions are different, because the expansive, spacious road of wickedness ends in death, and the road of virtue, so narrow and difficult, ends in life, not the life that ends, but life everlasting...&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The quote above looks very much like this from Gospels of St. Matthew in the King James Bible:
<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>
7:13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: 7:14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And that, interestingly, is followed by another line appropriate to many of the people that Don Quixote encounters:
<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>
7:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But most significantly I think Quixote&#8217;s experience in the Cave of Montesinos is very much like the experiences of Galahad and Lancelot in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0140442200%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0140442200%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" class="floatimgleft" id="2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0140442200%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">The Quest for the Holy Grail</a></em>, which I read in its &#8220;original&#8221; form before reading Don Quixote. I say original as opposed to, say, Sir Malory&#8217;s version because this so-called original is much more an allegory for the quest for nearness to God than a tale of errant knights. Book two of Don Quixote is much closer to the religious aspect of the quest, where Quixote is a lancelot character, a searcher, rather than a Galahad character, who is much closer to pureness than even Quixote would give himself credit for.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Quixote&#8217;s experience in the cave could be taken straight from the <em>Quest</em>, and Dulcinea&#8217;s enchantment, as false as it is (another theme!), looks much more now like the Lady in the Lake from the Arthurian tales. None of that should come as any great surprise, but in my mind, it is the religious aspect of the quest that is most striking and I think from what I know of the ending of the book, that idea will bear out, but I&#8217;ll have to wait and see.

		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2005/05/13/thank-you-for-not-reading-essays-on-literary-trivia-by-dubravka-ugresic/" title="<p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/ugresic.jpeg" style="float:left;margin-right:18px" alt="altimage" /> <strong>The Market and Ms. Ugresic</strong> <em>Thank You for Not Reading: Essays on Literary Trivia</em> by Dubravka Ugresic, Dalkey Archive Press.</p>
<p>We all have one of those friends, always ironic, quick with the comebacks and a wry opinion on just about everything. Dubravka Ugresic, one might surmise from reading her book of essays, is one of those people. The aptly named <em>Thank You for Not Reading: Essays on Literary Trivia</em> is a collection of 31 short pieces &#8211; smoothly translated from the Croation by Celia Hawkesworth&#8212;ostensibly about the state of the publishing industry.</p>
<p>I say ostensibly because <em>Thank You for Not Reading</em> is about much more than the publishing industry in all its celebrity chasing glory, it is a book with a unique perspective. Ugresic grew up in communist Yugoslavia, worked at the Institute for the Theory of Literature at the University of Zagreb, and left what is now Croatia in 1993. Today she lives in Amsterdam. Her point of view, always in sight here, is that of an intelligent woman&#8212;a writer in a narrowly spoken language&#8212;from a small country that has undergone ideological, political and calamitous change. </p>
<p>The book&#8217;s arc is from light to dark, never too dark, merely skimming the surface of a seriousness that by the end leaves the reader questioning Ugresic&#8217;s intentions. We begin with Eeyore as our mascot and are treated to a description of Joan Collins at the annual London Book Fair &quot;dressed like a quotation: in a little pink Chanel suit, with a pink pillbox hat on her head and a coquettish veil over her eyes.&quot; &quot;What does this have to do with literature?&quot; she asks. &quot;Almost nothing,&quot; she points out, and it is just this sort of trivia that has &quot;swamped contemporary literary life and become, it seems, more important than the books.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The writer who does not accept the rules of the market will simply perish . . . The world of the literary market is ruled by the producers of books, but producing books does not quite mean the same thing as producing literature.&quot;</p>
<p>With that, the premise of Ugresic&#8217;s book is settled and we are entertained with biting commentary on pitching literary agents, book blurbs, celebrity and pop culture, and The Market.</p>
<p>The word &quot;market&quot; can mean many things and it can be understood here as &quot;the publishing industry,&quot; but in my opinion, when Ugresic says market she does so with the mind of an Eastern European. I don&#8217;t mean to imply that she longs for a return to communism, indeed, as an intellectual, she seems to be stuck in the middle of two ideologies that have in her lifetime shown their ugly faces. No, I think the word market to her connotes something more like Chichikov&#8217;s trading of dead souls in Gogol&#8217;s novel, with all its metaphorical double meaning. The market she speaks of is seemingly harmless, yet opportunistic and ultimately evil. </p>
<p>It is irony that Ugresic revels in. In the essay &quot;Engineers of Human Souls&quot; she compares literature, essentially in America and Russia: &quot;The demands of the market have no ideology; they have been been cleansed of it, they are pure, desirable, wreathed in glamour and glory. What the market decides is confirmed by millions, and its moral dimension is not in question. The work is worth as much as we pay for it.&quot;</p>
<p>She says it. She knows it&#8217;s true, but we know that she doesn&#8217;t believe it. Similarly, she follows that passage with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The former communist, noncommercial cultures, particularly in Stalin&#8217;s days, must be given credit for the professionalism of the writer&#8217;s craft&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I maintain that Stalinism was a stern school of literary professionalism. Stalinism made writers into professionals, who would surely be rampaging through the international literary market now, if only they&#8217;d lived. Writers had to be professionals, it was a matter of life and death. Stalinist writers had to take great care to follow the rules of the game: the rules of socialist realism. Literature had to be comprehensible to the broad reading masses&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From there, Ugresic easily segues to contemporary commercial writers and mass producers of books, like Stephen King, that are &quot;comprehensible to the broad reading masses.&quot;</p>
<p>Ugresic&#8217;s strength is in making her point through anecdotal stories and putting context around her everyday observations. In &quot;How I Coud Have Been Ivana Trump and Where I Went Wrong,&quot; she chronicles the rise of her fellow Eastern European from small town Czech girl, national ski team member and model, to Donald Trump&#8217;s wife, businesswoman and finally celebrity writer. When the two meet, Ugresic finds &quot;her appearance somehow touching. With her exaggeratedly bleached hair, too-heavy make-up, and lips like fresh hot dogs.&quot;</p>
<p>Her point? &quot; . . . when my students ask me how one becomes a writer, I reply with complete authority: &#8216;Take up a sport and train like hell. Anything else could lead you in the wrong direction.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>While she&#8217;s good at inferring from the obvious, many of her earlier essays cover material that is too obvious or trite to even the most casual observer of the publishing world or pop culture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The blurb is one of these devices, only apparently innocent. If words such as fantastic, astonishing&#8230;and so on accompany the name of some well known person on the back of your own book, entrance to the world of references is almost guaranteed. And the well known person need not be a writer. Bill Gates and Madonna are more effective promoters than Gunter Grass. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of pop icons scattered throughout the book, including Oprah, Monika Lewinsky, O.J., the apparent media-influenced families of the Columbine victims, and the &quot;mega-death&quot; of Lady Di. The juxtaposition of death, celebrity, and media occur often here.</p>
<p>This obsession with the symbols of mass culture might be best explained in her essay &quot;The Role of Kirk Douglas in My Life&quot; where she describes growing up watching imported American movies and says &quot;I believe that we outdid the film critics of the time in our knowledge of the names of Hollywood actors,&quot; only to find out later that Kirk Douglas, who she had received a letter from as a young girl, had became an author:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was overcome by a sudden vague sadness&#8230; And then the sadness became an inner protest. The protest came from the sudden sense of my historical moment; the thought that everyone in the world has become a writer, literature was not a mountain peak which I had been trying to climb for years driven by the romantic notion that it belonged only to the persistent and dedicated, and that it was therefore only literary mountain-climbers who earned the right to write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we see this is a very personal book. Her contempt of popular culture rises from her own seriousness of craft and intellect contrasted with the easy ride to literary fame that the aura of celebrity has given to so many. The Hollywood images of her youth crashing with reality.</p>
<p>The earlier, lighter stories unfold into observations of an exiled writer: the suspect motivations of the writing and intellectual community in her home country, the corruption and malfeasance of her new so-called democratic government, and the sense of homelessness that even a self-willed exile feels. It is in this later part of the book that Ugresic really excels, by giving us a very real sense of her unique perspective. But it is here too that she fails, because we have been so long riddled with her cynicism, by now we don&#8217;t know what is true.</p>
<p>In many of her essays, Ugresic includes herself with those she damns, as if it&#8217;s okay to snarl when doing it in the mirror. But that does not justify all of her conclusions. For example, Ugresic takes on (without naming names, necessarily) the writers and intellectuals she would be a part of. In &quot;War is War, but Intellectuals Are Only Human,&quot; she says that the &quot;tragic disintegration of Yugoslavia was extensively covered by the media.&quot; True. But then she says that &quot;Miles of film and tons of paper were used up. Heaps of documentaries, films, books, photographs were produced, even souvenirs . . . &quot; She is still correct, but she goes on, and in discussing intellectuals, filmmakers and journalists as one massive lump of media, in this situation seems more sarcastic than thoughtful.</p>
<p>It seems that she is determined to leave no area of public or literary life untouched, but you only need to think of two people positively involved in the Balkan conflict, Susan Sontag and Jean-Luc Godard, both representing the opposite of everything Ms. Ugresic condemns, to see how thin a shield cynicism can be.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that she gets the media&#8217;s hold on culture wrong. In one of her best wry watercooler moments, she quotes a proponent of a &quot;Turn off Your TV Month&quot; as saying &quot;Who knows whether our campaign will have the same significance this time as it had last year, when we had fantastic media coverage.&quot; To her credit, she takes a wide swath of heavy topics such as globalization, war, culture, and a market driven publishing industry and treats them with enough levity to make the book entertaining. But it sometimes feels like a barrier, the way we tell jokes at a funeral when what we really want to do is scream our bloody heads off.</p>
<p>Toward the end, Ugresic returns again to her original theme: &quot;In the global market we are all sellers, even when it does not seem that way. Everyone automatically holds out his business card, everyone strives to be heard even when he has nothing to say&#8230; The only acceptable aesthetic choice that remains for people of good taste is silence.&quot;</p>

Simply the best bookstore in the city. Personal service, a rich history and a deep collection of serious literature. Both new and used books, including classics, poetry (probably the best in the city), many author-specific collections. The ultimate in browsing, even if the location is too midtowney to suggest from the outside that it has character. Gotham used to be the only place you needed to go to find literary journals. Since their recent move one block away - but seemingly a million miles from their old location - their journal collection has thinned. Hopefully that will change as they get settled in.

The owner has excellent taste and you can always find something interesting and new from some small presses as well as the majors. There are no used books here, so don't go looking for any bargains. Most but not all of the books at Three Lives are trade paperbacks. The poetry section is smallish, but there is a travel section, a New York section, staff picks and a selection of books on writing. The store hosts readings by popular authors, information about which you can find on their web-site. (p.s. Don't go to Three Lives without stopping by Joe, The Art of Coffee, for a near perfect ristretto espresso. Joe is around the block at the corner of Waverly and Gay.)

<strong>Mercer Street Books</strong>
<br />206 Mercer St. (at Bleeker)
<br />212 505-8615
</p>
<p>
This is one of my favorite used bookstores. They have a solid selection of fiction in hard and paper-back, literary criticism, classics and poetry. It's proximity to New York University is probably responsible for its good selection of criticism and other serious stuff; be sure to check out the recent arrivals table. They also have a selection of old literary journals, which are fun (if such things fit your idea of fun) to pick through randomly.

<p>
McNally Robinson is related to but independent of the Canadian company of the same name. It's great to see new bookstores opening and McNally Robinson appeared just last December in neighborhood nowadays called Nolita. They have pretty a active event calendar and a &#8220;tea house.&#8221; They have a small selection of literary journals, and a decent emphasis on good literature for a general bookstore. In fact, they have a &#8220;local poets&#8221; section set aside (of course this is New York City, so that could, practically speaking, be quite large, but it isn't. They also arrange their fiction into regions, which is unique and welcome. The selection is not huge, but appears to be thoughtful.
</p>
<p>
Update: I had previously reported that McNally Robinson had shrunk their literary selection, but after speaking to the folks there, I am assured that the space has grown, so I've retracted my earlier comment.
</p>
<p>
From Mcnally Robinson's buyer: &#8220;...the shelf space devoted to Lit has only grown since we opened...Literature happens to be squeezed into a physically tighter area in the more valuable upstairs real estate, but there are more books on the shelf than before. Initially I didn't believe it either.  Then I got a tape measure out. Interesting how we humans perceive space.&#8221;

<br />31 Third Ave. (at E. 9th)
<br />212 260-7853
</p>
<p>
Fairly mainstream bookstore, but St. Marks does have a good selection of literature/culture and art books that to some degree reflect the neighborhood. Probably the second best place, behind Gotham, for literary journals. The poetry and fiction sections are by no means comprehensive, but well chosen. There are no used books here. (p.s. If you go to St. Marks, you must stop by the Mud truck at the Astor Place subway for one of the best cups of coffee in the city.)

</p>
<p>
The UBC is a great store for browsing and finding bargains. You can find a book and relax in the cafe. The environment is warm, the building is classic and there's a pretty wide selection of literature, always very cheap. Also, your money is well spent here, because 100% of the profits go to Housing Works, a non-profit organization that provides housing, healthcare, job training, advocacy and many other services for homeless New Yorkers living with HIV and Aids. That alone is worth doing some shopping there. They are having a sale this weekend (Jan 8/9) too, when everything is 30% off.

<br />95 Fulton Street (3 blocks east of Broadway)
<br />212 732-6070
</p>
<p>
The Annex is much better for browsing than its parent. A fairly deep used fiction selection (a lot of hardbacks) and much more space between the shelves to maneuver (the main Strand store can get very cramped and crowded).
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://labyrinthbooks.com/StoreFrame.htm">Labyrinth Books</a></strong>
<br />536 West 112th Street (btwn. Brdwy/Amsterdam Ave.)
<br />212 865-1588
</p>
<p>
Described as a store of scholarly, literary &#038; cultural books, Labyrinth serves the Columbia U. smarties. This bookstore has an amazing literature collection, including poetry, but major authors only. You will sometimes find what you are looking for discounted 25%, but don't count on it. The real bargains are at the <a href="http://www.labyrinthbooks.com//main.asp?">sale annex</a>, which is only on-line, but where the prices tend to hover around $5-6. Some of the books from the annex, however, do find their way to Labyrinth's staircase even though that inventory doesn't seem to change much.

<br />828 Broadway (at 12th St.)

</p>
<p>
18 Miles of Books. Overated, but probably the best place to sell your used books. Great for browsing and with enough effort you may find some bargains, but there are tons of (only) slightly discounted books. The Strand does have one specialty that is unparalleled as far as I know and that is their reviewer's copy section, tucked away in the basement. These are all new and recently published books at 1/2 off of their original price. Don't expect to find anything hot there though.
</p>
<p>
The Strand also has a kiosk at 5th Ave and 60th for a quick fix on your way to Cipriani's for a $19 glass of scotch.
</p>
<p>
<strong>12th St. Books</strong>
<br />11 East 12th St.
<br />212 645-4340
</p>
<p>
A smallish all used bookstore with a mixture of hard and paper-backs and a variety of subjects. Never a first stop, but worth a drop by if you're at the Strand (which is close by).
</p>
<p>

<br />212 362-8905
</p>
<p>
Murder Ink claims to carry every mystery book in print and I think that speaks for itself. Next door, Ivy carries a mixture of new and used literature. It's a small, quaint, homey shop (I think it was in the Visa ad with Kevin Bacon) that is always worth a stop.
</p>

The best thing about BB is its location on a picturesque street in the village and the sale table outside. It seems that I always find a bargain there.

<p>
Okay, so the name is not too creative, but it's a pleasant stop with a small but well chosen selection of literature and non-fiction and an art space. There are bargains to be had on a small cart toward the front, but most of the inventory consists of new paperbacks. The bookstore serves at the pleasure of its owners who also own an art gallery nearby, choose the books and set up the impressive readings the store hosts.

<p>
Yeah, so it's on the Upper East Side. It's still a nice bookstore. Very Pleasant with a selection of the latest editions in literature and general non-fiction. Pretty mainstream stuff for the most part, but they have started their own &#8220;Chapbook Series&#8221; publishing and a &#8220;First Editions Club&#8221; if that's your sort of thing. I consider myself a reader, not a collector, but I do like to see bookshop owners venturing out and doing interesting things.

There are more Shake &#038; Co. locations than I've listed. The one on broadway tends to have somewhat subversive collection, but otherwise all of the stores are fairly mainstream. Some sell textbooks, most sell magazines, but light on the journals.

Ah, another Upper East Sider. Whenever I brush off my passport to go to that side of town I try to stop by Crawford Doyle. It's small and sells mostly new paperbacks and general non-fiction, but they do have an interesting collection of rare books to look at. It's always fun for an occasional browse.

</p>
<p>
Coliseum is overrated. They seem to be trying to be all things to all people. Now they have a cafe and a not terribly helpful staff. The selection is spotty (my impression is that it was better before they moved to their new location) and doesn't seem to be too serious anywhere. i.e. I never find myself saying...&#8220;I'm looking for X book, maybe I should stop at Coliseum first.&#8221;

</p>
<p>
Posman used to be a good bookstore. They used to be right next to NYU and carried textbooks and an interesting selection of some serious stuff that you might not find elsewhere. Now they are very general, they sell a lot of paperbacks and serve GCT commuters, not book lovers.

<br />212 308-0643
</p>
<p>
This store is dedicated to books by and about Winston Churchill. Much of their inventory is on-line, but the smallish store is pleasant and quiet with a small collection of literature and things like military books or foreign affairs, mostly in hardbound.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Westsider Used &#038; Rare</strong>
<br />2246 Broadway (at 80th)
<br />212 362-0706
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few opportunities to buy used books around the Upper West Side. There are a lot of books being sold on tables on the street and there are little bookstores tucked away where you wouldn't know they are there, such as Gryphon Bookshop. One of them (the name escapes me) finally gave up and closed its dusty doors, but there are still others fighting the good fight. Westsider is one of them. Books stacked to its very tall ceiling (it has a loft, so the main floor is two stories), it's a fun place to pop into once in a while. As with most used bookstores, you never know what you will find. Unfortunately, the fiction section seems to be all paperbacks, which are not appealing to me because they've already used a good part of their limited life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Biases:</strong>
</p>
<p>
This list is not meant to be a comprehensive list of stores. Here are my biases:
</p>
<p>
First, these are only Manhattan shops, where, for the moment, I hang my hat and therefore buy my books. There are great bookstores that I know about in Brooklyn and upstate New York and the Berkshires, but then things start to get out of hand.
</p>
<p>
This list is mostly concerned with literature and not special interests. In NYC there are bookstores that sell nothing but cookbooks, there are gay bookstores like the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore, there are travel bookstores, like the Complete Traveller (with an amazing used and rare travel book collection), stores that specialize in rare collectible books like Bauman's or Argosy, children's bookstores like Books of Wonder, art bookstores, and so on. Again, things would get out of hand if I were to try and write about all of them, and literature is my only interest in terms of the pastime of browsing for and buying books. I've also only listed independent stores here because no one needs me to tell them about Barnes &#038; Noble (although they do have a good annex on 18th st, their original store I think, where they have text books and such).
</p>
<p>
My last bias is that I really really like to find cheap used hardcover books; they last longer and tend not to have reader annotations (which I avidly add myself). I buy fiction, criticism and poetry. These stores are the places I go to find those things. If you know of a place worth checking out, I'd love to hear about it.

Do you recall the parable in Kafka's The Trial?
</p>
<blockquote>
Before the Law stands a door-keeper. To this door-keeper there comes a man from the country who begs for admittance to the Law. But the door-keeper says that he cannot admit the man at the moment. The man, on reflection, asks if he will be allowed, then, to enter later. 'It is possible,' answers the door-keeper, 'but not at this moment.' Since the door leading into the Law stands open as usual and the door-keeper steps to one side, the man bends down to peer through the entrance. When the door-keeper sees that, he laughs and says: 'If you are so strongly tempted, try to get in without my permission. But note that I am powerful. And I am only the lowest door-keeper. From hall to hall, keepers stand at every door, one more powerful than the other...
</blockquote>
<p>
Now substitute &#8220;Publishing&#8221; or &#8220;Mainstream Media&#8221; for &#8220;the Law.&#8221;

If you've <em>never</em> noticed the bridge in the Mona Lisa, then you know exactly what I mean.
</p>
<p>
The Guardian and New York Times seem to have embraced the niche created by literary blogs. Most recently, the <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk" target="_blank" title="Guardian">Guardian</a> has published their selection of &#8220;<a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/links/areas_of_interest/general/links/0,6135,1406190,00.html" title="top 10 literary blogs">top 10 literary blogs</a>,&#8221; which includes some familiar names like <a href="http://rakesprogress.typepad.com/rakes_progress/" target="_blank" title="The Rake">The Rake</a> and <a href="http://marksarvas.blogs.com/elegvar/" target="_blank" title="The Elegant Variation">TEV</a>, and surprisingly lacks a few I would expect to see, like <a href="http://maudnewton.com/blog/" target="_blank" title="Maud">Maud</a> and the <a href="http://www.complete-review.com/saloon/index.htm" target="_blank" title="Literary Saloon">Literary Saloon</a>, or <a href="http://www.mobylives.com/" target="_blank" title="Moby Lives">Moby Lives</a> and so many others that could easily fit into the &#8220;top ten&#8221; - a list that I assure you should not obligatorily include a site that was &#8220;Updated only sporadically - once or twice a month, on average,&#8221; or one without original content.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, some of the more <a href="http://www.beatrice.com/archives/001156.html" target="_blank" title="Guardian">popular</a> <a href="http://www.complete-review.com/saloon/archive/200502a.htm#kr8" target="_blank" title="Guardian">sites</a>, those &#8220;first tier&#8221; popular lit-blogs aren't too happy about being left out. But the real problem is that the entire idea of a &#8220;top 10&#8221; list is so arbitrary and confined as to make it meaningless. The medium is too new to even know what the best is, what a lit-blog should be and what in the long-term will be valuable to readers. I have over 50 literary oriented sites on my <a href="http://www.newsgator.com" target="_blank">Newsgator</a> account and most every one of them, commercial or not, popular or not, brings something unique to what has become required daily reading.
</p>
<p>
However, there are only so many blog-entries one can read every day and there are a growing number of sites out there, now that blogs are becoming more popular and the barrier to entry remains practically nil. Some blogs will never get any traction because of the time commitment these endeavors require and others will miss the mark or their authors will find the limits of their enthusiasm. But there are many sites, many that I, an avid reader and writer, have even yet to discover, and I wonder how can we all be contributing something worthwhile?

<p>
One of the advantages of this world of democratic publishing is that we can fine tune our intake of information to what we find valuable. I tend to write about books by dead authors on this site and I am fairly unconstrained as to the length of my posts. That's what I enjoy and so I've become comfortable with the fact that my site is not everyone's cup o' tea; I'm grateful for those that do read and comment. Conversely, I enjoy hearing about what's going on in the publishing world and with the hot new books being released by living authors (things I have little first-hand knowledge of), so I often find myself reading the sites that are quite the opposite of mine. You should hear me telling friends about this or that book they should read, when I only know about it from reading blogs.
</p>
<p>
I don't spend much time trying to find new blogs because I've invested a lot in finding and reading those that I already know. However, I'm always open to new voices and interested in seeing new ways writers find to express themselves and carry on the conversation - the <a href="http://gaddis-drinking-club.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Gaddis Drinking Club</a> being an interesting attempt at bringing several people together to write on one topic (next time let's not choose a thousand page book).
</p>
<p>
But the greatest challenge lies in the future. The landscape is changing such that some sites are growing in prominence, which may have yet-to-be known implications, new writers are getting involved and commercial enterprises are jumping into the pile of pick-up sticks.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the lit-blog world is a community of people settled by the commonality of their interests. But as has happened in the quaintest of hamlets, Wal-mart moves in and puts some of the locals out of business. The anecdotes about book deals influenced by blogs (one site has even published his blog posts as a book!), radio interviews and newspaper notices for the &#8220;best&#8221; bloggers can't help but to change the way writers approach their blogs. As I quoted in an earlier post on lit-blogs (<a href="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/09/most_things_und.html">Most Things Underground Tend to Surface</a>), the Economist magazine has said that blogging &#8220;also creates small, tight groups of readers that could make ideal target audiences for advertisers. Like search engines, once considered loss leaders, there is therefore an opportunity for 'monetising something cool'...&#8221; We all know that when you start talking about money, things change.
</p>
<p>
Now, I can only extrapolate from my own experience, but we blogging early adaptors - early adaptors indeed, that status confirmed by the bemused or empty looks we receive when we tell non-bloggers about our blogging - do this because we enjoy writing and we are very enthusiastic about the subject we have chosen to write about five or six days a week. For many, though probably not all, this is the only forum in which we are given the opportunity to write in such a way as to express our thoughts on a whim to whatever degree of depth we wish. There are a lot of these sites out there, and one just wonders as our hamlet grows into a city, will the resulting sprawl crowd out some of these great voices?

The introductory chapter reviews Gaddis's literary influences and discusses the perception that, as Moore quotes Cynthia Ozick, &#8220;Mr. Gaddis knows almost everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But allusion is just that and can't be mistaken for erudition. That is not to say that Gaddis was not well-read, but that his books were well researched and he wears his erudition on his sleeve, at least in <em>The Recognitions</em> (to be clear, I think Gaddis is brilliant, which shows in his writing, writing that needs not allusiveness to prove itself).
</p>
<p>
For example, all of the religious references in the book can be traced, according to Moore, to &#8220;a half dozen rather mundane sources.&#8221; But Moore says that by the time Gaddis wrote J.R. more than two decades later, &#8220;he became his own man and 'influences' all but disappear into the vast machinery of his work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
It seems impossible to really know what influences an author when writing; looking at the 73 pages of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0156002612/bookenompolic-20">footnotes</a> to T.S. Eliot's (23 page) poem, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375759344/bookenompolic-20">The Waste Land</a></em>, you notice an awful lot of conjecture based upon possible references pieced together with a combination of criticism and biography. Following the biographical path, Moore cites Gaddis's Harvard education, where Dryden, Chaucer and Elizabethan drama were part of the regimen, which Gaddis was &#8220;glad of.&#8221; And logically, Moore uses Gaddis's own statements and paper trail to develop a sense of his influences. The most important of those is Dostoyevski and the 19th century Russians:
</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;Gaddis's love for nineteenth century Russian literature in general crops up in his novels, his letters, and in his few lectures, where references are made to the major works of Dostoyevski, Tolstoy (especially the plays), Gogol, Turgenev, Gorky, Goncharov, and Chekhov. Gaddis shares with these authors not only their metaphysical concerns and often bizarre sense of humor, but their nationalistic impulses as well.&#8221;
</blockquote>
<p>
Moore also quotes Edward Wasiolek as saying that Gaddis pursues &#8220;perhaps the most distinctive trait of Russian fiction, to trace out the extreme, but logically possible, reaches of human characteristic.&#8221; I agree, except that, in my opinion, the &#8220;reaches of human characteristic&#8221; are at different extremes for 19th century Russians and the 20th century Americans that Gaddis wrote about.
</p>
<p>
Another major influence was T.S. Eliot. I mentioned in an earlier post that Gaddis had at one point intended to incorporate every line from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0156332256/bookenompolic-20">Four Quartets</a></em> into the novel. While there are many lines peppered throughout, the entire poem is not there as far as I understand - I gave up on my efforts to spot them after a while. Also in an <a href="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/11/reading_the_rec.html" title="Chekhov's Mistress on The Recognitions">earlier post</a>, I quoted from Four Quartets, a passage that I thought was particularly apt. But Moore says that another poem is really at the heart of this novel: &#8220;<em>The Recognitions</em> can be read as an epic sermon with <em>The Waste Land</em> as its text.&#8221; I've gone back and re-read these since beginning the book, and may, if I can come up with anything interesting to say, comment on them later.
</p>
<p>
Without going into specifics, Moore cites as &#8220;relevant,&#8221; Sade's <em>Justine</em>, Goethe's <em>Faust</em>, Rilke's <em>Duino Elegies</em>, Rimbaud's <em>A Season in Hell</em>, Broch's <em>Sleepwalkers</em>, Hesse's <em>Steppenwolf</em>, Silone's <em>And he Hid Himself</em>, some Ibsen, and Dante. Moore also quotes Gaddis as admitting &#8220;that when he first read Kafka in his early twenties he was so stunned by what Kafka could do that he 'sat down and wrote some very bad Kafka, though I thought of it as good Kafka then'.&#8221; Being stunned by Kafka is a sentiment that I am sure many writers share, myself included, and I recall Gabriel Garcia Marquez making a similar statement.
</p>
<p>
On the English front, relevant writers include C. Bront&#235;, Conrad, Forster, Waugh, Shakespeare, Langland, Kipling, T.E. Lawrence (as an aside, I tried to read <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em>, being a fan of Lawrence of Arabia, but found it dull. I always feel like I'm missing something when I don't like something as important as that), Huxley, Graves, and more.
</p>
<p>
Among the Americans, Moore cite's Gaddis's Bard College (where he taught for a short while) reading list, including Dreiser, Bellamy, Sinclair, Miller's <em>Death of a Salesman</em>, Salinger and even Dale Carnegie's <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em>. Also, Hawthorne, Melville, &#8220;some&#8221; Emerson, Thoreau's <em>Waldon</em>, West, Cummings (especially <em>1 x 1</em>), Faulkner's <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, and naturally Hemingway.
</p>
<p>
[I would go into more detail, but this is feeling much too like an eighth grader's book report and I know I'm capable of something in the ninth to tenth grade level.]
</p>
<p>
The names above sound like a good reading list for someone who wants to be a writer, perhaps only missing Stendhal, Proust (who Gaddis claims to have only read about 50 pages), the King James Bible, and...Joyce.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gaddis &amp; Joyce</strong>
</p>
<p>
In 1923, T.S. Eliot said of James Joyce's Ulysses, &#8220;a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.&#8221; No one knew the latter part of that statement better than William Gaddis, who joked that one academic essay went into so much &#8220;minute detail&#8221; on <em>The Recognitions</em> debt to <em>Ulysses</em> that &#8220;I was doubtful of my own firm recollection of never having read <em>Ulysses</em>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Gaddis, in a letter that Moore reprints to Joyce scholar, Grace Eckley, catalogs fairly precisely what he did (the Molly chapter of <em>Ulysses</em>, <em>Exiles</em> and some of <em>Dubliners</em>) and did not read of Joyce's and goes on to say after listing some other authors he did read, &#8220;why bother to go on, anyone seeking Joyce finds Joyce even if both Joyce &amp; the victim found the item in Shakespeare, read right past whole lines lifted bodily from Eliot &amp;c, all of which will probably go on so long as Joyce remains an academic cottage industry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I confess thinking myself that there must be a Joyce influence in here, and I find it amazing that someone of Gaddis's writerly disposition would have not read Joyce, and even more stunning that he didn't like Joyce's writing (Gaddis claims to not have finished Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man). T.S. Eliot was influenced, by his own admission, by Joyce and I often find that I feel compelled to read those who influenced those who are influencing me; that's the literary conversation into which I, like the kid who desperately wants to eat at the adult's table, can't resist trying to insinuate myself.
</p>
<p>
Jack Green says in his vociferous response to Gaddis's critics, <em><a href="http://www.nyx.net/~awestrop/ftb/ftb.htm" target="_blank" title="Fire the Bastards!">Fire the Bastards!</a></em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;ulysses &amp; the recognitions are very &#8221;20thcentury&#8220; &amp; have a number of technical resemblances: both are long &amp; closely organized; sharp contrast between humorous &amp; nonhumorous passages; lots of blasphemy; modeling/parodies on classics &amp; extensive crossreferences (ulysses having much more of former, recognitions of latter); &#8221;timegrowth&#8220; in rereading; many nonfictional references (miscalled &#8221;erudition&#8220;) to give desired tones to the fiction; passion for other books; importance of ideas of major characters (dedalus, wyatt); delight in carrying humorous situations to extremes; restraint as basic technique of style but the worlds of the 2 books arent alike, nor are the characters the 2 have little resemblance in the essential ie artistic sense.&#8221;
</blockquote>
<p>
At least acknowledging the similarities, Green's beef on this point is the critics' use of Joyce as an easy way out of thinking critically about the book. Indeed, it is too easy, considering that Moore gives us someone else to hang on to here. Ronald Firbank. Who? Described as a writer of &#8220;high camp comedy of manners and part fairy tail,&#8221;Firbank, an English writer who died in 1926, seems to wax and wane in popularity. The <a href="http://www.centerforbookculture.org/dalkey/backlist/firbank.html" target="_blank" title="Center for Book Culture">Center for Book Culture</a> (Dalkey Archive Press) has some of his books as well a few quotes and biographical details.
</p>
<p>
Moore claims Firbank, whose popularity was rising around the time Gaddis wrote <em>The Recognitions</em>, may have been a source for &#8220;elliptical dialogue - especially for effects usually achieved only in traditional exposition - and perhaps to have campy fun at Catholicism's expense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Just like Joyce's influence from the then out-of-print Dujardin, not all of the books in Gaddis's &#8220;Library of Babel&#8221; are part of the Western Canon that we all take for granted.
</p>

		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2004/10/07/in-praise-of-the-sublimely-unhip/" title="<p>Not too many years ago, I had a friend whose wife worked for a prominently fashionable clothing company. Nearly everyone she knew was Italian and worked in the fashion industry. I occasionally hung out with this crowd, going to clubs and even at times going to parties where we cooly walked through phalanxes of flashing paparazzi to make our way in.
</p>
<p>
Now the funny thing is that back then, I worked in a corporate job (before the corporate world went khaki, thankfully). I herded around with my hip friends mostly wearing a standard issue suit and stood out as if I were a body guard instead of a fashionista.
</p>
<p>
As a testament to the quality of the group, they accepted me as I was, even though I never really fit in. One very late night, one of the girls decided that my suit wouldn&#8217;t do and she unbuttoned my shirt a bit and put my collar on the outside of my lapel. It was not until the next day that I realized how ridiculous I looked, and that was the beginning of the end of my flirtation with being hip.
</p>
<p>
This is a very long way around saying that I am not hip (if my sisters are reading this, I am sure they are laughing by now, because they know how true that statement is).&nbsp; I don&#8217;t look hip, and certainly what I read is not hip.
</p>
<p>
That leads to two fairly new publications that seem to me to stand in contrast to one another in terms of their hipness and so many other aspects. One is <a href="http://www.zemblamagazine.com/">Zembla</a>, which is on their sixth issue; the other is <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/">n+1</a>, which is yet to publish their second issue. I&#8217;ve mentioned both here before and it&#8217;s no secret by now which of these I prefer.
</p>
<p>
When I picked up my first issue of Zembla, the &#8220;new international literary magazine,&#8221; I was excited by the prospect of finding &#8220;the most exciting book reviews&#8221; and the &#8220;fun with words&#8221; that the cover touted. Zembla, by the way, is a Nabokovian term and the name of the <a href="http://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/ozemble.htm">official site</a> of the International Vladimir Nabokov Society. There doesn&#8217;t appear to be any affinity between the ventures.
</p>
<p>
The first article I came across (in issue 4) was a piece called &#8220;Judging a Book by its Cover.&#8221; Forgetting for a second that I immediately disagree with the premise, the writing was so pretentious and materialistic that I nearly threw the magazine away.
</p>
<p>
The article equates the &#8220;dynamism&#8221; of a book with how large the text is and thus, how quickly one turns the pages; that being one argument for reading first editions and &#8220;gaining access to the text as it first appeared to the world.&#8221; To suggest that reading a modern paperback novel instead of an expensive first edition is like drinking &#8220;champagne from a disposable plastic beaker&#8221; misses entirely the point of reading. In fact, I might add, to extend the simile, that great champagne would probably taste so, no matter the medium.
</p>
<p>
Somehow in this very short article, the author manages to cover his distaste for &#8220;tinpot academics&#8221;, paperbacks, cheesy book covers and critics: <blockquote><p>&#8220;I have long borne a grudge against the critics, carping <i>in camera</i> at errors and inconsistencies, private irritations that have only rarely found public expression in vitriolic ink.&#8221;</p></blockquote> Yes, I too &#8220;carp <i>in camera</i>.&#8221;
<p>
Most of the magazine is visually oriented with far more graphics than text. As it turns out, when they said &#8220;fun with words&#8221;, they meant that they would splash them across the page like a child playing pick-up sticks, not in a literary sense. To wit, a supposed posthumous interview with Robert Louis Stevenson was barely readable because the text was sprawled across the page in multi-colored triangles.
</p>
<p>
The original writing (the issue contains a piece by Sylvia Plath) is not bad and there are articles on interesting topics, such as Drum magazine, and Bob Geldof, who is tellingly characterized as an &#8220;old geezer&#8221;. As I suppose would be required by a literary magazine, we are told how much the &#8220;furiously passionate and passionately furious&#8221; Geldof likes to read contemporary philosophy and history. But if we&#8217;re not impressed by his erudition, we are told - in the same sentence - about how the rock promoter counts among his friends important heads of state and tribal chiefs.
</p>
<p>
When the author of the Geldof article prefaces a statement on African colonization with &#8220;In the simplistic terms dictated by the confines of a magazine article,&#8221; I knew I was in the wrong place. In sum, Zembla is the literary version of something along the lines of a lifestyle magazine, like <a href="http://www.wallpaper.com/">Wallpaper*</a>. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that.
</p>
<p>
In stark contrast to Zembla, stands <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/">n+1</a> magazine with its red cover and near absence of graphics. The title alone evokes bad memories of calculus classes and states to me that the editors of this journal are clearly looking to find readers that consider themselves smart and that point is driven home by the articles listed on the cover, such as &#8220;The Intellectual Scene&#8221; and &#8220;Against Exercise,&#8221; because we all know that smart folks don&#8217;t go to the gym.
</p>
<p>
My first foray in the initial issue, subtitled &#8220;negation&#8221; I was amused by the somewhat audacious manner in which the editors chose to declare their space in the world of cultural journals. The editorial statment makes it clear that we live, despite &#8220;superstores&#8221; full of cultural magazines, in a repressed state where pornography and restaurant reviews are our literature. &#8220;The intellectual Scene&#8221; goes on to declare in a cozy &#8220;we&#8221; that <i>The New Republic</i> is the &#8220;designated hater&#8221; of journals and James Wood wants &#8220;to be his own grandfather;&#8217; McSweeney&#8217;s is considered in the past tense as a briefly significant magazine, and the <i>the Weekly Standard</i> is, well I&#8217;m not sure why that magazine is included in this line up.
</p>
<p>
All of this is understandable, just as the newly imprisoned convict immediately kicks ass on the biggest guy in the yard his first day, a journal has to put its feet firmly on the ground to survive in an overcrowded marketplace.
</p>
<p>
But as skeptical and slightly put-off as I started, I soon found n+1 quite a good journal. It&#8217;s articles are very well written, middling long in length - about right - and it covers topical issues in, I think, unique ways. Marco Roth&#8217;s piece &#8220;Why Literature Matters When It&#8217;s Somewhere Else&#8221; puts Azar Nafisi&#8217;s <i>Reading Lolita in Tehran</i> in context of what reading means to us as individuals, but also more broadly in terms of what reading means in other cultures compared to our own, about which he points out <blockquote><p>&#8220;Even in our free society there are Americans - lots of them - who are intimidated, who make bad choices or no choices, whose lives are a script written by others more powerful.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
It&#8217;s the mark of a skilled writer when we are deftly carried from a story about one book into a conversation about a broad and important theme.
</p>
<p>
While that was probably the best article, others stand out too. &#8220;Eggers, Teen Idol; or, The Education of Gary Baum&#8221; is a vicarious view into the world of an idolatrous young blogger in Calabasas California who manages, at the pimply age of sixteen, to tap into the literati scene in New York - at least for a while, before things get ugly. An article about Russian oil tycoons veers into a statement of how beliefs inform our perceptions of what we read.
</p>
<p>
A compellingly topical article called &#8220;Mogadishu, Baghdad, Troy&#8221; relates current events to the mythological story of the Iliad. While comparing Baghdad to Troy might at first seem trite, Mark Grief, the author makes us think about the destructive resolve of the Greeks by closing with ... <blockquote><p>&#8220;resolve is a word that has been grossly misused in recent months, and yet is most relevant&#8230; Our resolve is a public self-discovery that has yet to be made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
I&#8217;ve previously mentioned the n+1<a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/">website</a>, which continues to engage readers between issues and I&#8217;ve also mentioned the Zembla site, which continues to engage those that prefer pictures that slide by the screen to actual content. The sites seem to be representative of their respective journals.
</p>
<p>
Because of my opinion about n+1, I was surprised when I saw at <a href="http://maudnewton.com/blog/index.php?p=4186">Maud&#8217;s</a> an excerpt from the n+1 <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/conversation.html">site</a> relating the difficulties of a new journal trying to sell itself on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (where I live and where n+1&#8217;s editorial home is located) because...<blockquote><p>Bookseller: Yes, like I told you, it&#8217;s not a hip crowd. It&#8217;s not a cutting-edge crowd. These people do not want the new edgy, cutting-edge&#8212;
</p>
<p>
n+1: We&#8217;re not&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Bookseller: &#8212;they do not want the hip hot new thing. </p></blockquote>
<p>
Both magazines seem to be true to their editorial mandate and probably entertain their respective audiences, so I imagine its just a matter of personal style.
</p>
<p>
So consider the above in praise of the sublimely un-hip; may they not be perceived as too &#8220;cutting-edge&#8221; to be successful.

I suppose it's like noticing white Toyotas on the road once you have one, but blogs seem to be getting a lot of press lately. Lit blogs get noticed in a Book Babes <a href="http://poynter.org/content/content_print.asp?id=71720&amp;custom=" id="71720&amp;custom=">article</a> on <a href="http://poynter.org/">Poynter</a> On-line (link from <a href="http://www.beatrice.com/archives/000763.html">Beatrice</a>). Lit blogs have gotten their fair share of attention, but it is the news and political blogs in this election season that are really getting talked about.
</p>
<p>
The serious press have even devoted some ink to blogs, like this article on <a href="http://news.ft.com">The Financial Times</a> website, called <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/d70a0844-0d94-11d9-a3e1-00000e2511c8.html">Blogs and Bias</a>, which is really an article about media fragmentation. But among other things, the article says that bloggers were quicker to the punch on the CBS forged W documents than the rest of the press.
</p>
<p>
How do they do it? Read Maud Newton's <a href="http://maisonneuve.org/article.php?article_id=411" id="411">Maisonneuve article</a> that is as much about obsession as blogging.
</p>
<p>
Even the <a href="http://www.economist.com">Economist</a> has mentioned blogs in context of the media several times and recently has carried an article called <a href="http://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=1994135" id="1994135">Golden Blogs</a> where they point out, in their economist way that &#8220;it also creates small, tight groups of readers that could make ideal target audiences for advertisers. Like search engines, once considered loss leaders, there is therefore an opportunity for 'monetising something cool'...&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, when I was at the World Leadership Forum this week, one of the tech panels included a top exec at Gartner, who, on top of all the exciting technical hahoos he mentioned, seemed most excited about the Wiki concept, imbodied by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">Wikipedia</a> site that I mentioned in an earlier <a href="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/09/over_one_millio.html">post</a>.
</p>
<p>
Why is that interesting? Of all the exciting technical gadgets, the one thing that is most exciting to this guy who lives and breaths technology is the relatively low-tech concept of Wiki, which is similar to a blog, but is more collaborative in that others can add to and edit work over time.
</p>
<p>
I think blogs may head that way in time and we've already seen some excellent collaboration at <a href="http://noggs.typepad.com/the_reading_experience/2004/09/gilbert_sorrent.html">The Reading Experience</a> with dueling book reviews.
</p>
<p>
Other developments include <a href="http://allconsuming.net/">All Consuming</a>, a site that tracks blog comments on books, and <a href="http://kinja.com/">Kinja</a>, a site trying to tame the vastness of blogs into a portal format.
</p>
<p>
So, as the editor of Maisonneuve says in the Oct/Nov issue (the one with the Maud article on blogging), &#8220;most things underground tend to surface.&#8221;

		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2004/08/17/proust-changed-my-life-but-now-i-have-status-anxiety/" title="<p>I enjoy Alain de Botton&#8217;s books, but I don&#8217;t really like to admit it. It&#8217;s not as though they&#8217;re trashy novels, but they seem to have the scent of pseudo-intellectual manuals for wannabes. Maybe that&#8217;s me, I don&#8217;t know, but here is my reader&#8217;s journey through de Botton&#8217;s world.
My first encounter was with the work that will probably immortalize him, <i>How Proust Can Change Your life</i>, which I picked up from the shelf (where it is always placed with In Search of Lost Time instead of in the d&#8217;s), thumbed through thinking nothing more than that it was cute, and put it back.
Some time later I came across <i>The Consolation of Philosophy</i> while looking for Boethius&#8217; slightly older tome of the same name. Now gee, I thought, that&#8217;s interesting, so I bought it, read it like a gossip column and was not exactly consoled by learning that, for instance, Schopenhauer was lonely. The book seemed to excel at pithy summations like: &#8220;Happiness may be difficult to obtain. The obstacles are not primarily financial.&#8221; Great, a fortune cookie, I thought. Still, it was enjoyable to read and some of the biographical information on famous philosophers was interesting.
Then one day, while browsing through Ivy&#8217;s bookstore, I eyed a handsome hardback copy of de Botton&#8217;s <i>The Art of Travel</i>. Aye, thought I, that could be interesting as it was on a subject that I had long thought about. The concept of authentic traveling, as in, to quote Bowles, &#8220;I am a traveler, not a tourist&#8221; as well as the way that we &#8220;see&#8221; things when traveling, which Walker Percy wrote about, is fascinating to me. I couldn&#8217;t help it; I bought it, even though I rarely pay $23 for a book. My first impression, after never having bothered to think anything about this author, was that he was a very old man with a grandiloquent writing manner and somewhat stodgy tastes.
The <i>Art of Travel</i> begins:
&#8220;It was hard to say when exactly winter arrived. The decline was gradual, like that of a person into old age, inconspicuous from day to day until the season became an established, relentless reality.&#8221;
It&#8217;s actually a nice beginning, but set a tone for the book in which he discusses Flaubert and Wordsworth as if they were old friends. I soon found out though, that de Botton was only in his early thirties and had actually made something of a franchise for himself writing these whimsical didactic books on art and love and philosophy, and of course, Proust. After having found out that he was so young, the writing style and subject matter seemed to me a bit pretentious. An invalid impression really, but that&#8217;s how I felt.
I was soon rewarded however; within the first twenty pages de Botton hit upon a statement seemingly right out of Percy:
&#8220;It is unfortunately hard to recall our quasi-permanent concern with the future, for on our return from a place, perhaps the first thing to disappear from memory is just how much of the past we spent dwelling on what was to come - how much of it, that is, we spent somewhere other than where we were.&#8221;
This is one of de Botton&#8217;s better observations, but the book revolves around these profound statements, each reinforced by evidence from some respected dead person. By the end, I couldn&#8217;t say that I was a better traveler, but again, the book was enjoyable enough. It could be dull here and there and while it had structure, it seemed to have little real point; it was simply an enjoyable read under the guise of something a bit weightier.
I guess it was inevitable that I would eventually read <i>How Proust Can Change Your Life</i>, since that is where the journey began. In late 2003, the Lydia Davis translation of <i>Swann&#8217;s Way</i> was released (I bought the 6 volume set from Amazon U.K., which will not be released for sometime in the U.S., probably at least, until I get to reading them, but no matter). I was ready to go back for some more Proust and thought it would be a good time to read de Botton&#8217;s book as an aside.
This, of all his books, reads most like a self-help manual. It&#8217;s full of pithy conclusions on topics such as friendship, emotions and reading, supported, in this case, by the writings or biography of the slightly hermetic literary genius, Marcel Proust. By now, I had enough experience with the ways of Mr. de Botton to know that I would not learn anything, but would enjoy having a conversation, in a way, about M. Proust. My expectations were met. I did like the part where de Botton chastises idolators for going to Illiers-Combray on pilgrimages to see the quasi-fictional setting for Proust&#8217;s boyhood in <i>In Search of Lost Time.</i> I agreed with the sentiment and was glad that he said it, being that, I would suppose, many of those pilgrims would be reading this very book.
And that brings me to <i>Status Anxiety</i>, which my wife bought me, at my request, for Father&#8217;s day (my first by the way). I know what I&#8217;m getting into here, but I still have mixed emotions about where these books fit. <i>Status Anxiety</i> begins with a chapter on &#8220;Our Need for Love, Our Desire for Status.&#8221; I&#8217;m just not interested, but somehow simultaneously compelled to read it.
I guess I&#8217;m just jealous in a - I wish I thought of that - kind of way. Ultimately, I like de Botton&#8217;s books for no other reason than the subject matter usually revolves around something interesting, even if the ostensible topic does not, and they are easy reads. So I&#8217;m jealous because I should be writing fun pointless books like that instead of merely pointless blog entries like this.

		<li>&lt;a href="/article/2004/08/06/wise-men-have-fished-here-homage-to-the-gotham-book-mart/" title="<p><i>I was inspired by a comment on yesterday&#8217;s post to write this, but this is also a good time to mention Gotham Book Mart because it is finally making a long anticipated move to a new location after 58 years at the old site and 84 years in existence.</i></p>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders have vast shelves of books on seemingly every topic, practically decent coffee shops and a friendly staff. I have a well worn B&amp;N discount card that I use at the &#8220;superstore&#8221; 3 blocks from my house whenever I need something quickly or it&#8217;s raining &#8211; and it rains all too frequently in these parts. Amazon is also amazing with its great prices and an apparently infinite selection of books; those smiley boxes (you know what I&#8217;m talking about) appear from nowhere on my doorstep as if manna from heaven. So why bother with any other book store?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t honestly say. Perhaps for a sense of discovery? Maybe there&#8217;s an ineffable essence that one picks up in a bookstore where the buyer, the one who is responsible for every book on the shelf, is not stuffed away in a centrally located cubicle, but is the owner or manager standing close by to answer your questions. Could it be the randomness of the mingled used and new books stacked from floor to ceiling, some long out of print, others you&#8217;ve just never heard of before? Is it that hard back copy of <i>The Magic Mountain</i> or some other great novel that will live far longer than its $6.98 price tag would suggest? We could just chalk it up to all these, plus a bit of mysticism, but when it comes down to it, great bookstores have more than just books, they have soul and they&#8217;re not just a store, but a destination. Gotham Book Mart is one of those places.</p>
<p>Walking into the Gotham for the first time, you don&#8217;t immediately get the sense of history that goes along with the dusty stacks and the fat cat laying in the back (named Tom, after Pynchon). Unless you already know beforehand, you may not even realize it on your first visit. But then, as you linger over the shelves for a while, you begin to notice that most of the pictures of literary luminaries hanging on the scarce wall space were probably taken right there and the others are inscribed to the owner of the store. According to its web-site the store has counted among its customers W.H.&nbsp; Auden, Randall Jarrell, Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, Anais Nin, Thornton Wilder, J.D. Salinger, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams among others in an exhaustively famous list of literary lions (some are in the photo below, for a key to the faces, go the Gotham web-site linked at the end of this piece). Maybe some of these people would have gone to Barnes &amp; Noble, but they never would have become a part of the fabric of any generic superstore. </p>

<p>Frances Steloff opened Gotham Book Mart in 1920 after selling books from her window with a sign that said &#8220;Interesting Books Selected by Myself.&#8221; Ms. Steloff lived for 101 years and in the store&#8217;s early years she was very much a part of the literary scene in New York City. According to the website: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gotham and Miss Steloff championed the experimental and challenged the  censors over the years.&#160; She supplied James Joyce&#8217;s books to US readers  as they were  published, including those with legal difficulties from the US&#8217;s obscenity  laws, a service she also provided for D.H. Lawrence and Henry Miller&#8217;s  work.&#160; She was one of the founding members of the James Joyce Society,  whose meetings continue at the Gotham, and Joyce himself occasionally ordered books directly from Miss  Steloff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once at Gotham I saw a first edition copy of the Paris Review&#8217;s <i>Writers at Work</i> collection, the second in the series, published in 1963. This book had a famous interview with Ernest Hemingway, along with Boris Pasternak, T.S. Eliot, Ralph Ellison, and many others. I wasn&#8217;t interested in paying for the first edition (I&#8217;m a reader not a collector), so I asked Flip, the manager, for another copy. He dug that and others out for me, and the conversation evolved from there to talk about Joyce and Borges. Next thing I know, he&#8217;s making phone calls to find information for me on an exhibit of Borges books (sadly) brought from Argentina for sale. That&#8217;s what I call a Superstore.</p>
<p>But besides that book-culture thing you get from shopping there, which I&#8217;m sure will remain even after the move, Gotham is just a great place to browse. They really do have books stacked from floor to ceiling, many of them at great prices and the combination of new and used books jostling for your attention assures that you will always find something interesting. For all the books that they have laying around the store, a recent NY Times article says that there are 200,000 more in the back room, and hopefully some of those will make it out into the daylight at the new shop.</p>
<p><img alt="gotham" src="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/images/gotham.jpg" width="320" height="217" border="0" /></p>
<p>Gotham specializes in contemporary fiction, but besides that, they also have quite a few specialty areas, too numerous to mention. They tend to segregate books in interesting ways. Classics are together as well as Romantic period books, there&#8217;s a film section, a decent selection of literary criticism, and mysteries (if I remember correctly) and biography are segregated, and of course, there&#8217;s a  special section for James Joyce. </p>
<p>The poetry section is bewilderingly thorough with all the familiar names intermixed with soon-to-be familiar names. Authors like Dante, Auden, Eliot and Yeats and Pound have their own sections, tucked away toward the bottom of the shelves. As a compliment to all the great books, Gotham has an incredible selection of literary journals. Because of the nature of these little slices of obscurity, there are often back issues laying on the shelves too.</p>
<p>Andreas Brown, Gotham&#8217;s current owner, sold the building where the store is located last year and just recently signed a long-term lease for the H.P. Kraus building a block away. I and other regular patrons had been asking about the move for some time, but the employees were mum. I had not been in for a while, so was surprised when I saw the notice. </p>
<p>I find it interesting that an independent bookstore is thriving among the price and inventory competition of the national chains. Those that are surviving must be offering something more, and I think Gotham Book Mart is exemplary of what a great bookstore can and should be. Long live Gotham! </p>
<p>I will conclude with the following excerpt from the August 4th New York Times article regarding Gotham&#8217;s move:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Both buildings have five stories, but the Kraus has about twice the space, Mr. Brown said. It is lined with bookcases, many of them antique. The second floor has a ballroom-size open area that will be used for publication parties and meetings of the James Joyce Society and other groups. At the old Gotham there was often an overflow crowd for such occasions. In the window at the Kraus building is a raised platform, which could be used as a stage for theatrical events.
<p>The third floor, where Kraus and his wife, Hanni, held conferences and entertained important clients, will become an art gallery. The upper floors will be used for office and storage space and as a place to develop a Gotham Web site.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks Mr. Brown and his employees have been packing books and archival photographs and moving them to the new location. Regarding the clutter at the 46th Street store, he said that the old Gotham was messier when its founder, Frances Steloff, was alive. (She opened the store in 1920 and moved twice, staying within a two-block area.) When he bought it, he installed air-conditioning and tried to impose order on the books.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more I straightened things out,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the more customers complained.&#8221; They were apparently attracted to the chaos, hoping to stumble on some serendipitous find. That kind of environment appealed to Mr. Brown as a book buyer, but not as a bookseller.</p>
<p>The Gotham sign, &#8220;Wise Men Fish Here,&#8221; which was designed by the artist John Held Jr., will soon be placed on the facade of the new location. Will wise men still be able to fish for books at the new Gotham? &#8220;I think they will,&#8221; Mr. Brown said, and, thinking about the disorder in the old shop, he added, &#8220;but it will be more like a lake.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>"I have dipped into books of aesthetics, but I had an uncomfortable feeling that I was reading the works of astronomers who had never looked at the stars. They were writing about poetry as if poetry were a task, and not what it really is, a passion, and a joy."</blockquote>
<p>This is particularly apt because the post I was responding to quoted several new players in publishing technology characterizing books as “…an amount of knowledge that I feel good about finishing” and “a bag of words,” stripping away their essence, the shared consciousness a book of any kind represents. We could probably put a stake in the ground on the day Apple introduced the iPhone  - or perhaps the iPad  - and say that was the day the technologists became publishers. So what’s so bad about this?</p>
