For the past decade I’ve been a designer and developer of websites. I enjoy the constant renewal and problem solving of this work. I work with organizations and people I admire for their contributions to the world. I have three children and one wife. I love roasting and brewing coffee. I’m an ambivert. I value curiosity and learning. I like challenging books. Gadget junkie. I agree that there are only two types of music.
