  <div class="entry-content prose">

    
    <p>In 2012 the developers for the Obama campaign moved from an ExpressionEngine-based website to serving static HTML pages generated by open source software called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The success of that website, which was a model of performance and stability even with over 81 million page views, has set a movement afoot for web developers to utilize a more straightforward and less bloated technology stack than had become the norm over the past decade. </p>

<p>Static site generators, like the one used by the Obama campaign, marry text documents and layout templates to generate HTML pages, which are then pushed to the server. There is no content management system and no database.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>The heart of a “traditional” CMS driven website is a SQL database where all the site’s content and settings are organized into tables with rows and columns, much like a very complicated spreadsheet. Each CMS has its own scheme of organizing this information based on the perceived needs of its users and the system’s goals. On top of the database there is an application layer to convert the data into pages, route those pages into web addresses to serve to end users, and manage various user functions like inputing content through a WYSIWYG editor. </p>

<p>The process of looking up data in a table to convert to a web page is time consuming, yet is typically done only at the point that a reader visits a web page. This added time, which, even measured in seconds, is detrimental to the user’s experience, particularly on mobile devices.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Many websites cache (save pre-rendered web pages in memory) to speed up the process, though that tends to only add a another layer of complexity rather than solve the original problem.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> </p>

<p>Traditional MySQL databases not only tend to cause performance bottlenecks but are entry points for hacking, and are difficult to maintain in a version control system, and act as a barrier to moving content from one system to another. Even free open source systems come at a great cost of maintenance and hosting at scale as well as reliance on a variety of add-on developers that is costly over time.</p>

<p>This is not to suggest that database driven websites are inherently bad in all cases, there are gains to be had by bypassing databases and focusing on content. </p>

<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>

<p>Ben Balter, Github Gov 2.0 Evangelist and former Presidential Innovation Fellow, calls this the “Post-CMS” world<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>, and I believe he’s right, to a degree. Solutions such as Jekyll or other “static site generators” (there are many) are not content management systems because they only process files, or convert documents and templates into HTML pages. However, it’s only the database and system of application layers that is missing. What we are left with for “content management” is a set of files in folders, much like what we are all used to using on a day-to-day basis, replacing that concept with “document management.”</p>

<p>In the real world we organize our little bits of data into spreadsheets and our text in documents, yet in the world of CMS driven websites we lump all of our documents as though they were bits of data into spreadsheet-like rows, which in turn creates a separation between us and our content.</p>

<p>This is what a document might look like in a static site:</p>

<p>- - -<br />
title: Title<br />
category: Category<br />
layout: article<br />
date: November 10, 2013<br />
author: authorname<br />
- - -<br />
content goes here</p>

<hr />
<p>This is a text document that can be moved or shared with ease. In a database driven website the information above may be separated into as many as three or four different tables. While a highly organized database isn’t inherently wrong, document-based templating systems maintain the connection between the creator of the content and the resulting document.</p>

<h3 id="cost-effectiveness--faster-iterations">Cost Effectiveness &amp; Faster Iterations</h3>

<p>Static sites don’t require as complex web server setups so are much cheaper to host. In fact, depending on the circumstances, they can be hosted for free on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github’s Pages</a> service, which tightly ties their version control with the site’s hosting.</p>

<p>Another example of a website that was originally planned to be on a commercial CMS then moved to static is the information portal of healthcare.gov (not the problematic back-end application). This website has over a thousand pages organized for various users and was built with the same tools as the Obama campaign website. As a result of the move from a CMS to static, the site’s server requirements went from 32 servers down to one.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The lack of rigidity in developing sites without a CMS make changes much faster to put into effect. The ease of version control also makes it such that a developer or developers anywhere can contribute to the site’s development and a site can easily be “forked,” that is copied for use on another site, in a matter of minutes. The entire website can be treated as an open source project (it can also be kept private in this set up).</p>

<p>Summary of Benefits
The primary benefits of using static sites generators are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>performance</li>
  <li>stability</li>
  <li>cost effectiveness</li>
  <li>faster iterations</li>
  <li>relative simplicity</li>
  <li>replicability</li>
</ul>
