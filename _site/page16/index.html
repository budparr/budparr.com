    <p>
If you've <em>never</em> noticed the bridge in the Mona Lisa, then you know exactly what I mean.
</p>
<p>
The Guardian and New York Times seem to have embraced the niche created by literary blogs. Most recently, the <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk" target="_blank" title="Guardian">Guardian</a> has published their selection of &#8220;<a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/links/areas_of_interest/general/links/0,6135,1406190,00.html" title="top 10 literary blogs">top 10 literary blogs</a>,&#8221; which includes some familiar names like <a href="http://rakesprogress.typepad.com/rakes_progress/" target="_blank" title="The Rake">The Rake</a> and <a href="http://marksarvas.blogs.com/elegvar/" target="_blank" title="The Elegant Variation">TEV</a>, and surprisingly lacks a few I would expect to see, like <a href="http://maudnewton.com/blog/" target="_blank" title="Maud">Maud</a> and the <a href="http://www.complete-review.com/saloon/index.htm" target="_blank" title="Literary Saloon">Literary Saloon</a>, or <a href="http://www.mobylives.com/" target="_blank" title="Moby Lives">Moby Lives</a> and so many others that could easily fit into the &#8220;top ten&#8221; - a list that I assure you should not obligatorily include a site that was &#8220;Updated only sporadically - once or twice a month, on average,&#8221; or one without original content.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, some of the more <a href="http://www.beatrice.com/archives/001156.html" target="_blank" title="Guardian">popular</a> <a href="http://www.complete-review.com/saloon/archive/200502a.htm#kr8" target="_blank" title="Guardian">sites</a>, those &#8220;first tier&#8221; popular lit-blogs aren't too happy about being left out. But the real problem is that the entire idea of a &#8220;top 10&#8221; list is so arbitrary and confined as to make it meaningless. The medium is too new to even know what the best is, what a lit-blog should be and what in the long-term will be valuable to readers. I have over 50 literary oriented sites on my <a href="http://www.newsgator.com" target="_blank">Newsgator</a> account and most every one of them, commercial or not, popular or not, brings something unique to what has become required daily reading.
</p>
<p>
However, there are only so many blog-entries one can read every day and there are a growing number of sites out there, now that blogs are becoming more popular and the barrier to entry remains practically nil. Some blogs will never get any traction because of the time commitment these endeavors require and others will miss the mark or their authors will find the limits of their enthusiasm. But there are many sites, many that I, an avid reader and writer, have even yet to discover, and I wonder how can we all be contributing something worthwhile?

<p>
One of the advantages of this world of democratic publishing is that we can fine tune our intake of information to what we find valuable. I tend to write about books by dead authors on this site and I am fairly unconstrained as to the length of my posts. That's what I enjoy and so I've become comfortable with the fact that my site is not everyone's cup o' tea; I'm grateful for those that do read and comment. Conversely, I enjoy hearing about what's going on in the publishing world and with the hot new books being released by living authors (things I have little first-hand knowledge of), so I often find myself reading the sites that are quite the opposite of mine. You should hear me telling friends about this or that book they should read, when I only know about it from reading blogs.
</p>
<p>
I don't spend much time trying to find new blogs because I've invested a lot in finding and reading those that I already know. However, I'm always open to new voices and interested in seeing new ways writers find to express themselves and carry on the conversation - the <a href="http://gaddis-drinking-club.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Gaddis Drinking Club</a> being an interesting attempt at bringing several people together to write on one topic (next time let's not choose a thousand page book).
</p>
<p>
But the greatest challenge lies in the future. The landscape is changing such that some sites are growing in prominence, which may have yet-to-be known implications, new writers are getting involved and commercial enterprises are jumping into the pile of pick-up sticks.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the lit-blog world is a community of people settled by the commonality of their interests. But as has happened in the quaintest of hamlets, Wal-mart moves in and puts some of the locals out of business. The anecdotes about book deals influenced by blogs (one site has even published his blog posts as a book!), radio interviews and newspaper notices for the &#8220;best&#8221; bloggers can't help but to change the way writers approach their blogs. As I quoted in an earlier post on lit-blogs (<a href="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/09/most_things_und.html">Most Things Underground Tend to Surface</a>), the Economist magazine has said that blogging &#8220;also creates small, tight groups of readers that could make ideal target audiences for advertisers. Like search engines, once considered loss leaders, there is therefore an opportunity for 'monetising something cool'...&#8221; We all know that when you start talking about money, things change.
</p>
<p>
Now, I can only extrapolate from my own experience, but we blogging early adaptors - early adaptors indeed, that status confirmed by the bemused or empty looks we receive when we tell non-bloggers about our blogging - do this because we enjoy writing and we are very enthusiastic about the subject we have chosen to write about five or six days a week. For many, though probably not all, this is the only forum in which we are given the opportunity to write in such a way as to express our thoughts on a whim to whatever degree of depth we wish. There are a lot of these sites out there, and one just wonders as our hamlet grows into a city, will the resulting sprawl crowd out some of these great voices?

        Gaddis’s Library of Babel
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2005</span>

    <p style="text-align:center">
<em>&#8220;When it was announced that the Library contained all books, the first reaction was unbound joy. All men felt themselves the possessors of an intact and secret treasure.&#8221;</em>
<br />- J.L. Borges, The Library of Babel
</p>
<p>
Gaddis's <em>The Recognitions</em> seems to be a vast repository of literary allusions and the best of modernist influence. But it ain't necessarily so, says Mr. Gaddis and Steven Moore. I recently picked up a copy of Steven Moore's &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/080577534X/bookenompolic-20" target="_blank" title="William Gaddis">William Gaddis</a>,&#8221; his 1989 collection of criticism. The introductory chapter reviews Gaddis's literary influences and discusses the perception that, as Moore quotes Cynthia Ozick, &#8220;Mr. Gaddis knows almost everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But allusion is just that and can't be mistaken for erudition. That is not to say that Gaddis was not well-read, but that his books were well researched and he wears his erudition on his sleeve, at least in <em>The Recognitions</em> (to be clear, I think Gaddis is brilliant, which shows in his writing, writing that needs not allusiveness to prove itself).
</p>
<p>
For example, all of the religious references in the book can be traced, according to Moore, to &#8220;a half dozen rather mundane sources.&#8221; But Moore says that by the time Gaddis wrote J.R. more than two decades later, &#8220;he became his own man and 'influences' all but disappear into the vast machinery of his work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
It seems impossible to really know what influences an author when writing; looking at the 73 pages of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0156002612/bookenompolic-20">footnotes</a> to T.S. Eliot's (23 page) poem, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375759344/bookenompolic-20">The Waste Land</a></em>, you notice an awful lot of conjecture based upon possible references pieced together with a combination of criticism and biography. Following the biographical path, Moore cites Gaddis's Harvard education, where Dryden, Chaucer and Elizabethan drama were part of the regimen, which Gaddis was &#8220;glad of.&#8221; And logically, Moore uses Gaddis's own statements and paper trail to develop a sense of his influences. The most important of those is Dostoyevski and the 19th century Russians:
</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;Gaddis's love for nineteenth century Russian literature in general crops up in his novels, his letters, and in his few lectures, where references are made to the major works of Dostoyevski, Tolstoy (especially the plays), Gogol, Turgenev, Gorky, Goncharov, and Chekhov. Gaddis shares with these authors not only their metaphysical concerns and often bizarre sense of humor, but their nationalistic impulses as well.&#8221;
</blockquote>
<p>
Moore also quotes Edward Wasiolek as saying that Gaddis pursues &#8220;perhaps the most distinctive trait of Russian fiction, to trace out the extreme, but logically possible, reaches of human characteristic.&#8221; I agree, except that, in my opinion, the &#8220;reaches of human characteristic&#8221; are at different extremes for 19th century Russians and the 20th century Americans that Gaddis wrote about.
</p>
<p>
Another major influence was T.S. Eliot. I mentioned in an earlier post that Gaddis had at one point intended to incorporate every line from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0156332256/bookenompolic-20">Four Quartets</a></em> into the novel. While there are many lines peppered throughout, the entire poem is not there as far as I understand - I gave up on my efforts to spot them after a while. Also in an <a href="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/11/reading_the_rec.html" title="Chekhov's Mistress on The Recognitions">earlier post</a>, I quoted from Four Quartets, a passage that I thought was particularly apt. But Moore says that another poem is really at the heart of this novel: &#8220;<em>The Recognitions</em> can be read as an epic sermon with <em>The Waste Land</em> as its text.&#8221; I've gone back and re-read these since beginning the book, and may, if I can come up with anything interesting to say, comment on them later.
</p>
<p>
Without going into specifics, Moore cites as &#8220;relevant,&#8221; Sade's <em>Justine</em>, Goethe's <em>Faust</em>, Rilke's <em>Duino Elegies</em>, Rimbaud's <em>A Season in Hell</em>, Broch's <em>Sleepwalkers</em>, Hesse's <em>Steppenwolf</em>, Silone's <em>And he Hid Himself</em>, some Ibsen, and Dante. Moore also quotes Gaddis as admitting &#8220;that when he first read Kafka in his early twenties he was so stunned by what Kafka could do that he 'sat down and wrote some very bad Kafka, though I thought of it as good Kafka then'.&#8221; Being stunned by Kafka is a sentiment that I am sure many writers share, myself included, and I recall Gabriel Garcia Marquez making a similar statement.
</p>
<p>
On the English front, relevant writers include C. Bront&#235;, Conrad, Forster, Waugh, Shakespeare, Langland, Kipling, T.E. Lawrence (as an aside, I tried to read <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em>, being a fan of Lawrence of Arabia, but found it dull. I always feel like I'm missing something when I don't like something as important as that), Huxley, Graves, and more.
</p>
<p>
Among the Americans, Moore cite's Gaddis's Bard College (where he taught for a short while) reading list, including Dreiser, Bellamy, Sinclair, Miller's <em>Death of a Salesman</em>, Salinger and even Dale Carnegie's <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em>. Also, Hawthorne, Melville, &#8220;some&#8221; Emerson, Thoreau's <em>Waldon</em>, West, Cummings (especially <em>1 x 1</em>), Faulkner's <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, and naturally Hemingway.
</p>
<p>
[I would go into more detail, but this is feeling much too like an eighth grader's book report and I know I'm capable of something in the ninth to tenth grade level.]
</p>
<p>
The names above sound like a good reading list for someone who wants to be a writer, perhaps only missing Stendhal, Proust (who Gaddis claims to have only read about 50 pages), the King James Bible, and...Joyce.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gaddis &amp; Joyce</strong>
</p>
<p>
In 1923, T.S. Eliot said of James Joyce's Ulysses, &#8220;a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.&#8221; No one knew the latter part of that statement better than William Gaddis, who joked that one academic essay went into so much &#8220;minute detail&#8221; on <em>The Recognitions</em> debt to <em>Ulysses</em> that &#8220;I was doubtful of my own firm recollection of never having read <em>Ulysses</em>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Gaddis, in a letter that Moore reprints to Joyce scholar, Grace Eckley, catalogs fairly precisely what he did (the Molly chapter of <em>Ulysses</em>, <em>Exiles</em> and some of <em>Dubliners</em>) and did not read of Joyce's and goes on to say after listing some other authors he did read, &#8220;why bother to go on, anyone seeking Joyce finds Joyce even if both Joyce &amp; the victim found the item in Shakespeare, read right past whole lines lifted bodily from Eliot &amp;c, all of which will probably go on so long as Joyce remains an academic cottage industry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I confess thinking myself that there must be a Joyce influence in here, and I find it amazing that someone of Gaddis's writerly disposition would have not read Joyce, and even more stunning that he didn't like Joyce's writing (Gaddis claims to not have finished Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man). T.S. Eliot was influenced, by his own admission, by Joyce and I often find that I feel compelled to read those who influenced those who are influencing me; that's the literary conversation into which I, like the kid who desperately wants to eat at the adult's table, can't resist trying to insinuate myself.
</p>
<p>
Jack Green says in his vociferous response to Gaddis's critics, <em><a href="http://www.nyx.net/~awestrop/ftb/ftb.htm" target="_blank" title="Fire the Bastards!">Fire the Bastards!</a></em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;ulysses &amp; the recognitions are very &#8221;20thcentury&#8220; &amp; have a number of technical resemblances: both are long &amp; closely organized; sharp contrast between humorous &amp; nonhumorous passages; lots of blasphemy; modeling/parodies on classics &amp; extensive crossreferences (ulysses having much more of former, recognitions of latter); &#8221;timegrowth&#8220; in rereading; many nonfictional references (miscalled &#8221;erudition&#8220;) to give desired tones to the fiction; passion for other books; importance of ideas of major characters (dedalus, wyatt); delight in carrying humorous situations to extremes; restraint as basic technique of style but the worlds of the 2 books arent alike, nor are the characters the 2 have little resemblance in the essential ie artistic sense.&#8221;
</blockquote>
<p>
At least acknowledging the similarities, Green's beef on this point is the critics' use of Joyce as an easy way out of thinking critically about the book. Indeed, it is too easy, considering that Moore gives us someone else to hang on to here. Ronald Firbank. Who? Described as a writer of &#8220;high camp comedy of manners and part fairy tail,&#8221;Firbank, an English writer who died in 1926, seems to wax and wane in popularity. The <a href="http://www.centerforbookculture.org/dalkey/backlist/firbank.html" target="_blank" title="Center for Book Culture">Center for Book Culture</a> (Dalkey Archive Press) has some of his books as well a few quotes and biographical details.
</p>
<p>
Moore claims Firbank, whose popularity was rising around the time Gaddis wrote <em>The Recognitions</em>, may have been a source for &#8220;elliptical dialogue - especially for effects usually achieved only in traditional exposition - and perhaps to have campy fun at Catholicism's expense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Just like Joyce's influence from the then out-of-print Dujardin, not all of the books in Gaddis's &#8220;Library of Babel&#8221; are part of the Western Canon that we all take for granted.

        In Praise of the Sublimely Unhip
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2004</span>

    <p>Not too many years ago, I had a friend whose wife worked for a prominently fashionable clothing company. Nearly everyone she knew was Italian and worked in the fashion industry. I occasionally hung out with this crowd, going to clubs and even at times going to parties where we cooly walked through phalanxes of flashing paparazzi to make our way in.
</p>
<p>
Now the funny thing is that back then, I worked in a corporate job (before the corporate world went khaki, thankfully). I herded around with my hip friends mostly wearing a standard issue suit and stood out as if I were a body guard instead of a fashionista.
</p>
<p>
As a testament to the quality of the group, they accepted me as I was, even though I never really fit in. One very late night, one of the girls decided that my suit wouldn&#8217;t do and she unbuttoned my shirt a bit and put my collar on the outside of my lapel. It was not until the next day that I realized how ridiculous I looked, and that was the beginning of the end of my flirtation with being hip.
</p>
<p>
This is a very long way around saying that I am not hip (if my sisters are reading this, I am sure they are laughing by now, because they know how true that statement is).&nbsp; I don&#8217;t look hip, and certainly what I read is not hip.
</p>
<p>
That leads to two fairly new publications that seem to me to stand in contrast to one another in terms of their hipness and so many other aspects. One is <a href="http://www.zemblamagazine.com/">Zembla</a>, which is on their sixth issue; the other is <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/">n+1</a>, which is yet to publish their second issue. I&#8217;ve mentioned both here before and it&#8217;s no secret by now which of these I prefer.
</p>
<p>
When I picked up my first issue of Zembla, the &#8220;new international literary magazine,&#8221; I was excited by the prospect of finding &#8220;the most exciting book reviews&#8221; and the &#8220;fun with words&#8221; that the cover touted. Zembla, by the way, is a Nabokovian term and the name of the <a href="http://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/ozemble.htm">official site</a> of the International Vladimir Nabokov Society. There doesn&#8217;t appear to be any affinity between the ventures.
</p>
<p>
The first article I came across (in issue 4) was a piece called &#8220;Judging a Book by its Cover.&#8221; Forgetting for a second that I immediately disagree with the premise, the writing was so pretentious and materialistic that I nearly threw the magazine away.
</p>
<p>
The article equates the &#8220;dynamism&#8221; of a book with how large the text is and thus, how quickly one turns the pages; that being one argument for reading first editions and &#8220;gaining access to the text as it first appeared to the world.&#8221; To suggest that reading a modern paperback novel instead of an expensive first edition is like drinking &#8220;champagne from a disposable plastic beaker&#8221; misses entirely the point of reading. In fact, I might add, to extend the simile, that great champagne would probably taste so, no matter the medium.
</p>
<p>
Somehow in this very short article, the author manages to cover his distaste for &#8220;tinpot academics&#8221;, paperbacks, cheesy book covers and critics: <blockquote><p>&#8220;I have long borne a grudge against the critics, carping <i>in camera</i> at errors and inconsistencies, private irritations that have only rarely found public expression in vitriolic ink.&#8221;</p></blockquote> Yes, I too &#8220;carp <i>in camera</i>.&#8221;
<p>
Most of the magazine is visually oriented with far more graphics than text. As it turns out, when they said &#8220;fun with words&#8221;, they meant that they would splash them across the page like a child playing pick-up sticks, not in a literary sense. To wit, a supposed posthumous interview with Robert Louis Stevenson was barely readable because the text was sprawled across the page in multi-colored triangles.
</p>
<p>
The original writing (the issue contains a piece by Sylvia Plath) is not bad and there are articles on interesting topics, such as Drum magazine, and Bob Geldof, who is tellingly characterized as an &#8220;old geezer&#8221;. As I suppose would be required by a literary magazine, we are told how much the &#8220;furiously passionate and passionately furious&#8221; Geldof likes to read contemporary philosophy and history. But if we&#8217;re not impressed by his erudition, we are told - in the same sentence - about how the rock promoter counts among his friends important heads of state and tribal chiefs.
</p>
<p>
When the author of the Geldof article prefaces a statement on African colonization with &#8220;In the simplistic terms dictated by the confines of a magazine article,&#8221; I knew I was in the wrong place. In sum, Zembla is the literary version of something along the lines of a lifestyle magazine, like <a href="http://www.wallpaper.com/">Wallpaper*</a>. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that.
</p>
<p>
In stark contrast to Zembla, stands <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/">n+1</a> magazine with its red cover and near absence of graphics. The title alone evokes bad memories of calculus classes and states to me that the editors of this journal are clearly looking to find readers that consider themselves smart and that point is driven home by the articles listed on the cover, such as &#8220;The Intellectual Scene&#8221; and &#8220;Against Exercise,&#8221; because we all know that smart folks don&#8217;t go to the gym.
</p>
<p>
My first foray in the initial issue, subtitled &#8220;negation&#8221; I was amused by the somewhat audacious manner in which the editors chose to declare their space in the world of cultural journals. The editorial statment makes it clear that we live, despite &#8220;superstores&#8221; full of cultural magazines, in a repressed state where pornography and restaurant reviews are our literature. &#8220;The intellectual Scene&#8221; goes on to declare in a cozy &#8220;we&#8221; that <i>The New Republic</i> is the &#8220;designated hater&#8221; of journals and James Wood wants &#8220;to be his own grandfather;&#8217; McSweeney&#8217;s is considered in the past tense as a briefly significant magazine, and the <i>the Weekly Standard</i> is, well I&#8217;m not sure why that magazine is included in this line up.
</p>
<p>
All of this is understandable, just as the newly imprisoned convict immediately kicks ass on the biggest guy in the yard his first day, a journal has to put its feet firmly on the ground to survive in an overcrowded marketplace.
</p>
<p>
But as skeptical and slightly put-off as I started, I soon found n+1 quite a good journal. It&#8217;s articles are very well written, middling long in length - about right - and it covers topical issues in, I think, unique ways. Marco Roth&#8217;s piece &#8220;Why Literature Matters When It&#8217;s Somewhere Else&#8221; puts Azar Nafisi&#8217;s <i>Reading Lolita in Tehran</i> in context of what reading means to us as individuals, but also more broadly in terms of what reading means in other cultures compared to our own, about which he points out <blockquote><p>&#8220;Even in our free society there are Americans - lots of them - who are intimidated, who make bad choices or no choices, whose lives are a script written by others more powerful.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
It&#8217;s the mark of a skilled writer when we are deftly carried from a story about one book into a conversation about a broad and important theme.
</p>
<p>
While that was probably the best article, others stand out too. &#8220;Eggers, Teen Idol; or, The Education of Gary Baum&#8221; is a vicarious view into the world of an idolatrous young blogger in Calabasas California who manages, at the pimply age of sixteen, to tap into the literati scene in New York - at least for a while, before things get ugly. An article about Russian oil tycoons veers into a statement of how beliefs inform our perceptions of what we read.
</p>
<p>
A compellingly topical article called &#8220;Mogadishu, Baghdad, Troy&#8221; relates current events to the mythological story of the Iliad. While comparing Baghdad to Troy might at first seem trite, Mark Grief, the author makes us think about the destructive resolve of the Greeks by closing with ... <blockquote><p>&#8220;resolve is a word that has been grossly misused in recent months, and yet is most relevant&#8230; Our resolve is a public self-discovery that has yet to be made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
I&#8217;ve previously mentioned the n+1<a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/">website</a>, which continues to engage readers between issues and I&#8217;ve also mentioned the Zembla site, which continues to engage those that prefer pictures that slide by the screen to actual content. The sites seem to be representative of their respective journals.
</p>
<p>
Because of my opinion about n+1, I was surprised when I saw at <a href="http://maudnewton.com/blog/index.php?p=4186">Maud&#8217;s</a> an excerpt from the n+1 <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/conversation.html">site</a> relating the difficulties of a new journal trying to sell itself on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (where I live and where n+1&#8217;s editorial home is located) because...<blockquote><p>Bookseller: Yes, like I told you, it&#8217;s not a hip crowd. It&#8217;s not a cutting-edge crowd. These people do not want the new edgy, cutting-edge&#8212;
</p>
<p>
n+1: We&#8217;re not&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Bookseller: &#8212;they do not want the hip hot new thing. </p></blockquote>
<p>
Both magazines seem to be true to their editorial mandate and probably entertain their respective audiences, so I imagine its just a matter of personal style.
</p>
<p>
So consider the above in praise of the sublimely un-hip; may they not be perceived as too &#8220;cutting-edge&#8221; to be successful.

I suppose it's like noticing white Toyotas on the road once you have one, but blogs seem to be getting a lot of press lately. Lit blogs get noticed in a Book Babes <a href="http://poynter.org/content/content_print.asp?id=71720&amp;custom=" id="71720&amp;custom=">article</a> on <a href="http://poynter.org/">Poynter</a> On-line (link from <a href="http://www.beatrice.com/archives/000763.html">Beatrice</a>). Lit blogs have gotten their fair share of attention, but it is the news and political blogs in this election season that are really getting talked about.
</p>
<p>
The serious press have even devoted some ink to blogs, like this article on <a href="http://news.ft.com">The Financial Times</a> website, called <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/d70a0844-0d94-11d9-a3e1-00000e2511c8.html">Blogs and Bias</a>, which is really an article about media fragmentation. But among other things, the article says that bloggers were quicker to the punch on the CBS forged W documents than the rest of the press.
</p>
<p>
How do they do it? Read Maud Newton's <a href="http://maisonneuve.org/article.php?article_id=411" id="411">Maisonneuve article</a> that is as much about obsession as blogging.
</p>
<p>
Even the <a href="http://www.economist.com">Economist</a> has mentioned blogs in context of the media several times and recently has carried an article called <a href="http://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=1994135" id="1994135">Golden Blogs</a> where they point out, in their economist way that &#8220;it also creates small, tight groups of readers that could make ideal target audiences for advertisers. Like search engines, once considered loss leaders, there is therefore an opportunity for 'monetising something cool'...&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, when I was at the World Leadership Forum this week, one of the tech panels included a top exec at Gartner, who, on top of all the exciting technical hahoos he mentioned, seemed most excited about the Wiki concept, imbodied by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">Wikipedia</a> site that I mentioned in an earlier <a href="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/09/over_one_millio.html">post</a>.
</p>
<p>
Why is that interesting? Of all the exciting technical gadgets, the one thing that is most exciting to this guy who lives and breaths technology is the relatively low-tech concept of Wiki, which is similar to a blog, but is more collaborative in that others can add to and edit work over time.
</p>
<p>
I think blogs may head that way in time and we've already seen some excellent collaboration at <a href="http://noggs.typepad.com/the_reading_experience/2004/09/gilbert_sorrent.html">The Reading Experience</a> with dueling book reviews.
</p>
<p>
Other developments include <a href="http://allconsuming.net/">All Consuming</a>, a site that tracks blog comments on books, and <a href="http://kinja.com/">Kinja</a>, a site trying to tame the vastness of blogs into a portal format.
</p>
<p>
So, as the editor of Maisonneuve says in the Oct/Nov issue (the one with the Maud article on blogging), &#8220;most things underground tend to surface.&#8221;

        Proust Changed My Life, But Now I have Status Anxiety
      </a>

    <span class="post-date">17 Aug 2004</span>

    <p>I enjoy Alain de Botton&#8217;s books, but I don&#8217;t really like to admit it. It&#8217;s not as though they&#8217;re trashy novels, but they seem to have the scent of pseudo-intellectual manuals for wannabes. Maybe that&#8217;s me, I don&#8217;t know, but here is my reader&#8217;s journey through de Botton&#8217;s world.
My first encounter was with the work that will probably immortalize him, <i>How Proust Can Change Your life</i>, which I picked up from the shelf (where it is always placed with In Search of Lost Time instead of in the d&#8217;s), thumbed through thinking nothing more than that it was cute, and put it back.
Some time later I came across <i>The Consolation of Philosophy</i> while looking for Boethius&#8217; slightly older tome of the same name. Now gee, I thought, that&#8217;s interesting, so I bought it, read it like a gossip column and was not exactly consoled by learning that, for instance, Schopenhauer was lonely. The book seemed to excel at pithy summations like: &#8220;Happiness may be difficult to obtain. The obstacles are not primarily financial.&#8221; Great, a fortune cookie, I thought. Still, it was enjoyable to read and some of the biographical information on famous philosophers was interesting.
Then one day, while browsing through Ivy&#8217;s bookstore, I eyed a handsome hardback copy of de Botton&#8217;s <i>The Art of Travel</i>. Aye, thought I, that could be interesting as it was on a subject that I had long thought about. The concept of authentic traveling, as in, to quote Bowles, &#8220;I am a traveler, not a tourist&#8221; as well as the way that we &#8220;see&#8221; things when traveling, which Walker Percy wrote about, is fascinating to me. I couldn&#8217;t help it; I bought it, even though I rarely pay $23 for a book. My first impression, after never having bothered to think anything about this author, was that he was a very old man with a grandiloquent writing manner and somewhat stodgy tastes.
The <i>Art of Travel</i> begins:
&#8220;It was hard to say when exactly winter arrived. The decline was gradual, like that of a person into old age, inconspicuous from day to day until the season became an established, relentless reality.&#8221;
It&#8217;s actually a nice beginning, but set a tone for the book in which he discusses Flaubert and Wordsworth as if they were old friends. I soon found out though, that de Botton was only in his early thirties and had actually made something of a franchise for himself writing these whimsical didactic books on art and love and philosophy, and of course, Proust. After having found out that he was so young, the writing style and subject matter seemed to me a bit pretentious. An invalid impression really, but that&#8217;s how I felt.
I was soon rewarded however; within the first twenty pages de Botton hit upon a statement seemingly right out of Percy:
&#8220;It is unfortunately hard to recall our quasi-permanent concern with the future, for on our return from a place, perhaps the first thing to disappear from memory is just how much of the past we spent dwelling on what was to come - how much of it, that is, we spent somewhere other than where we were.&#8221;
This is one of de Botton&#8217;s better observations, but the book revolves around these profound statements, each reinforced by evidence from some respected dead person. By the end, I couldn&#8217;t say that I was a better traveler, but again, the book was enjoyable enough. It could be dull here and there and while it had structure, it seemed to have little real point; it was simply an enjoyable read under the guise of something a bit weightier.
I guess it was inevitable that I would eventually read <i>How Proust Can Change Your Life</i>, since that is where the journey began. In late 2003, the Lydia Davis translation of <i>Swann&#8217;s Way</i> was released (I bought the 6 volume set from Amazon U.K., which will not be released for sometime in the U.S., probably at least, until I get to reading them, but no matter). I was ready to go back for some more Proust and thought it would be a good time to read de Botton&#8217;s book as an aside.
This, of all his books, reads most like a self-help manual. It&#8217;s full of pithy conclusions on topics such as friendship, emotions and reading, supported, in this case, by the writings or biography of the slightly hermetic literary genius, Marcel Proust. By now, I had enough experience with the ways of Mr. de Botton to know that I would not learn anything, but would enjoy having a conversation, in a way, about M. Proust. My expectations were met. I did like the part where de Botton chastises idolators for going to Illiers-Combray on pilgrimages to see the quasi-fictional setting for Proust&#8217;s boyhood in <i>In Search of Lost Time.</i> I agreed with the sentiment and was glad that he said it, being that, I would suppose, many of those pilgrims would be reading this very book.
And that brings me to <i>Status Anxiety</i>, which my wife bought me, at my request, for Father&#8217;s day (my first by the way). I know what I&#8217;m getting into here, but I still have mixed emotions about where these books fit. <i>Status Anxiety</i> begins with a chapter on &#8220;Our Need for Love, Our Desire for Status.&#8221; I&#8217;m just not interested, but somehow simultaneously compelled to read it.
I guess I&#8217;m just jealous in a - I wish I thought of that - kind of way. Ultimately, I like de Botton&#8217;s books for no other reason than the subject matter usually revolves around something interesting, even if the ostensible topic does not, and they are easy reads. So I&#8217;m jealous because I should be writing fun pointless books like that instead of merely pointless blog entries like this.
