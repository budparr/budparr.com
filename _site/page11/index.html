        A Jazz Lexicon - 'A unique and rebellious way of speaking...'
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2010</span>

    <p>Another find while packing (see my previous post on <a href="http://budparr.posterous.com/take-the-scenic-route-to-knowledge-on-brewers"><em>Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</em></a>) is Bob Gold’s <em>A Jazz Lexicon</em> from 1964. My copy is signed “To the Richardson All-Stars - Richie, Johnnie, Jon &amp; Brooke - with love, Bob Gold 7/23/64” A quick look on the internet and some of my other jazz books gave me no clue to who those guys were but the inscription gives it a nice sense of authenticity and begs the history of the book; how it might have found it’s way from someone in the Richardson All-Stars to a used bookstore in Brookyn, where I bought it.</p>
<div>This dictionary is for 20th Century slang from the jazz set. I found a letter to the editor of the New York Review of Books by the author on the use of the word "hep:"</div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">Your recent correspondent, Cal Kolbe Nossiter, in attempting to correct Philip Rahv's nominal use of "hip" merely proliferates the error by identifying the term "hip" as a variant of "hep." Anyone familiar with the jazz scene (or anyone familiar with my recent dictionary of jazz slang, A Jazz Lexicon) knows that the word has always been "hip," and that "hep" is hopelessly square.</blockquote>
<div>For instance, "pork chop"</div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">[prob. from jazzman's approval of both; according to jazzmen, current c. 1900-c 1917, obs. since; see also BARRELHOUSE, GULLY-LOW, LOWDOWN] Slow, earthy blues music. Oral evidence only.</blockquote>
<div>To "collar the jive" was a phrase used by Cab Calloway and part of general slang earlier in the century to mean "to understand and fee rapport with what is being said; to be in the know; to be hip. c1935 jive term."</div>
<div>Like the <em>Brewer's Dictionary</em>, it's tempting to write these words off as quaint, particularly much of the drug-culture related slang, but here especially they represent a history, one with sociological resonance, as Gold points out in his introduction: "...So we get a people in rebellion against a dominant majority, but forced to rebel secretly, to sublimate, as the psychologist would put it--to express themselves culturally through the medium of jazz, and linguistically through a code, a jargon..."</div>
<div>And because much of the language from the early jazz era was spoken, its presence here is all the more remarkable. As much as I love my lovely found hardback copy, if there were ever a case for the digitization of books, having this now out-of-print history of a special set of words is an acute one.</div>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2010</span>

    <p>Packing my books away for our move, I keep running into great things I’ve not looked at in a while. One of them is <em>Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable</em>. I love dictionaries and reference books in the first place–have quite a few–but this one is truly unique. My edition is from 1970, the “Centenary Edition” as it was first published in 1870. To its credit, it’s never been out of print, but truth is, even though there’s a newer edition out this year even, it doesn’t matter to me because the old dictionaries show words to be something of an artifact and etymologies don’t really capture how meaning evolves (or devolves!, as the case may be).</p>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>The definition for "screw" goes like this:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">"Slang for wages, salary; possibly because in some employments it was handed out in 'screwed up on paper' or because it was 'screwed out' of one's employer; it is also slang for a prison warder, from the days when the locks were operated from a screw-like movement."</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Modern definitions, while much more thorough, are, needless to say, nothing like this one. Likewise, "Screwed" is defined here as "intoxicated. A playful synonym of <em>tight</em>." Of course in a modern context these definitions seem merely quaint, but there are tons of things here that just don't exist now either.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You'll find entries, for example, with stories like that of "John o' Groats":</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">"The site of a legendary house 1 3/4 miles west of Duncansby Head Caithness, Scotland. The story is of...three Dutch brothers, came to this part of Scotland in the reign of James IV. There came to be eight families of the name and they met annually to celebrate. On once occasion a question of precedency arose, consequently John o'Groat built an eight-sided room with a door to each side and placed an octagonal table therein so that all were 'head of the table'. This building went ever after with the name of John o' Groat's House."</blockquote>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>At any rate, Dr Ebenezer Cobham Brewer was, as far as I can tell from his biography in the "Centenary Edition," a man who did little besides read, write and garden. The list of books he wrote or edited is astounding, beginning in 1841 (Brewer was born in 1810) with <em>A Guide to Science</em>, which went into 47 editions and sold more than 319,000 copies by 1905. He wrote books on accounting, scripture, Greek, Roman, French history, as well as a <em>Political, Social, and Literary History of Germany</em>, and near the end of his life, <em>A Dictionary of Miracles</em>.</div>

        History is the blood...
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2010</span>

    <p><img class="alignnone" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/budparr/v4ljgkg06AKnd4YQFP4RjXXAtefuIM6dxEOXiFsMapYmPPBAJvEpvKPOxhMJ/spcivilwar.jpg.thumb100.jpg?content_part=6tJaY3nVJ3suoFAAIPRw" alt="" width="100" height="100" />This quote rings true… “History is the blood running through the river while life goes on on the banks.”</p>

<p>I’ve been reading – at the rate of about 10 pages per day – Hugh Thomas’s <em>The Spanish Civil War</em>, a book I’ve had since I began reading on the war either thematically or as a subject about five years ago. I hadn’t ventured into it because it’s thick and dense; about 950 pages of history, it’s not my usual reading. But I realized when recently reading Bola<span style="font-family: Helvetica">ño’s <em>Monsieur Pain</em> that there were still huge gaps in my understanding of the Spanish Civil War (in that particular instance it was something about the Falangists that piqued my interest) . </span></p>

<p>I’ve only gotten into the period prior to the war so far, a large swath covering the last quarter of the 19th Century and early 20th, but one would gather that in this time there was nothing going on but violence and murder, riots, anarchy. I don’t doubt that it was like that  – look at parts of modern Mexico or Colombia for but two examples– but in light of the discussion going on around David Sheilds’ <em>Reality Hunger: A Manifesto</em> (which I haven’t read, but have been following the discussions) about the move to “nonfiction” I’d say that the true story, the “truer than” true story that is well written and well imagined fiction, is what happens on the banks and that’s where we get understanding.</p>

<p>I’d go as far as saying that reading history is incomplete without reading the fiction, if it exists, around a period or events. It’s well known that Tolstoy’s <em>War &amp; Peace</em> is itself a history and while that novel may be an exception for its reading as an historical text it supports the idea that the sensitivity of a novelist who brings facts to life might be more valuable than the historian for the purposes that history serves, that is, not repeating our mistakes or inferring a better way to act.</p>

<p>However, the facts, which we know evolve over time, at least many of them, are merely guideposts or backdrop in my view. If you’ve ever been in a catastrophe reported in the news you know that the experience for most is far from the reality reported in the press. I recently read a blog post from a woman in Chile during the earthquake. Her report was more mundane than the press reports, but more human in my view and probably good fodder for a story (please understand that I’m only talking about story telling here and not trying to be unsympathetic to those lives affected by the tragedy).</p>

<p>But back to Spain.</p>

<p>While I’m not naive enough to think that life in Spain was just like Trueba’s romantic conception in the movie “Belle Epoque,” it’s shocking how the political upheaval in the Spain of that period permeated this otherwise cute film (in particular the priest’s suicide on the couple’s wedding day). I suppose that may have been the director’s intent. History is served through art. The thesis behind Javier Mar<span style="font-family: Helvetica">ías’s novel <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em> is that we don’t really know people we think we know. We can’t see what they will be like in the future, which is why the thread of the Spanish Civil War is so important to that book. A civil war is a war of betrayal and no where does that become more apparent or real than in a story, which in this case is a fictionalized remembrance of actual events. </span></p>

<p>For what it’s worth, my Spanish Civil War reading list is a mix of fiction and nonfiction. These are books that I’ve read, am reading, or intend to read, but far from comprehensive and not necessarily meant to be as it’s just one of those things that has taken up its own life in my reading.</p>

<p>Here’s the list. While I’m probably not interested in adding any more history books to this list because I think Thomas’s is particularly comprehensive, I’d love to hear any other reading suggestions you might have.</p>

<p>Hugh Thomas: <em>The Spanish Civil War</em></p>

<p>Javier Cercas: <em>The Soldiers of Salamis</em></p>

<p>Roberto <span style="font-family: arial;font-size: small">Bolaño: <em>Monsieur Pain</em> (this is on tangentially about the SCW)</span></p>

<p>Javier <span style="font-family: arial;font-size: small">Mar<span style="font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 12px">ías: <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em>, Vols 1, 2 and 3</span></span></p>

<p>Camilo Jose Cela: <em>San Camilo, 1936</em></p>

<p>Bernardo Atxaga: <em>The Accordianist’s Son</em></p>

<p>Ian Gibson: <em>The Death of Lorca</em></p>

<p>George Orwell: <em>Homage to Catalonia</em></p>

<p>Ernest Hemingway: <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em></p>

<p>Ernest Hemingway: <em>The Fifth Column…</em> (not sure about this one because I can’t find it now)</p>

<p>Stephen Koch: <em>The Breaking Point - Hemingway, Dos Passos, and the Murder of Jose Robles</em></p>

<p>Russell Martin: <em>Picasso’s War: The Extraordinary Story of an Artist, an Atrocity and a Painting That Shook the World</em></p>

<p>Various poetry from the period.</p>

<p><em>
</em></p>

<p>I’ve seen mention of Raymond Carr’s <em>The Spanish Tragedy</em> and I’d be interested to know if you’ve read it.</p>

        What Do You Do When You Sit and Listen?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Dec 2009</span>

    <p>What do you do when you sit and listen to music or to someone read? The mind has a difficult time taking in images and sound at the same time, so the one or the other becomes a distraction. The reader’s facial expression, or with music, perhaps you marvel at the player’s technical skill instead of wholly taking it in. Even reading a book there’s a minuscule element, no matter how lost we may get in the narrative, that we are holding an object and reading words on a page and our back may be sore or our nails need clipping. Even more difficult with poetry because we can’t waste any words getting into the groove of things. This is why I always read poetry aloud. But even then.</p>

<p>Cut to a different topic and think for a second if you’ve ever seen the media of literature and video combined smartly, so that one does not become merely a distraction for the other. I can think of only rare instances when this works. Videos of readings, which are just a ‘couldn’t be there’ or saved for posterity thing, but not really of interest on their own. Then there’s some neat animations to accompany poetry I’ve seen. But then the animations take over the poetry, and that’s not good. The poetry is cheapened that way.</p>

<p>Today I read Christina Mengert’s review at <a href="http://www.constantcritic.com/christina_mengert/the-last-4-things/">The Constant Critic</a> of Kate Greenstreet’s <em>The Last 4 Things</em>. Mengert begins with an interesting observation:</p>
<blockquote>A few years ago, I had the pleasure of hearing Kate Greenstreet read from her first book,<em>Case Sensitive</em> (Ahsahta 2006). It struck me, at the time, how much her reading style conveyed the sense of thought in real time, as opposed to language that has been permanently crystallized and is now being rehearsed. The poems, in her mouth, carried a certain elusive feeling of spontaneity. I wondered if the poems on the page felt quite so alive, and was forced to admit, upon reading them, that while they did feel alive in a way, it seemed an inescapable quandary that once locked into the page, a poem felt, well, fixed.</blockquote>
<p>Read the rest of her <a href="http://www.constantcritic.com/christina_mengert/the-last-4-things/">review</a>, please, for a more in-depth look on how well the poetry works.</p>

    <div style="float:left;margin-right:15px"><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/bpy_thumb.jpg" /><br /><span class="small"></span></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve become addicted to your iPhone in the oddest ways, even though the phone service itself is horrible. I use it as a flashlight when I walk my son to the bathroom at night, and everyone knows it&#8217;s a great distraction for your kids (<a href="http://iphoneappdemos.tv/2009/02/bebot-robot-synth/">Bebot</a>, <a href="http://brushesapp.com/">Brushes</a>). That is if you can get it away from them or if they don&#8217;t make odd phone calls or emails to your clients (if you&#8217;ve ever gotten an email from me with nothing but &#8220;yrixoxyt&#8221; in the body, it came from Seamus).</p>
<p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/shorteroed.png" width="103" height="111" style="float:right;margin-left:8px" /> Among the myriad practical little apps, I became obsessed with &#8220;The Weather Channel&#8221; app over the summer, hoping each time that the little cloud icons would turn to sun (they never did). But what I truly love about my iPhone is the <a href="http://www.mobisystems.com/product.html?p=13&amp;l=1&amp;pid=281&amp;i=1">Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</a> app. For me, that alone is worth the price. Yes, it&#8217;s expensive for an iPhone app, but we&#8217;re talking about a massive dictionary, second only to the <span class="caps">OED</span> itself, always at your side (My other preferred dictionary, the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2009-07/Webster.html">controversial</a> Merriam-Webster Unabridged, I use online, if needed). The truly geeky can even use the &#8220;random word&#8221; button &#8211; when faced with nothing else to do &#8211; until you find something you don&#8217;t know. </p>
<p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/indiebound_thumb.png" width="150" height="148" style="float:left;margin-right:8px" /> More than once I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/iphone">IndieBound&#8217;s</a> iPhone app for looking up books when the conversation hinges upon remembering that author (and anyone who knows me knows I have a horrible memory). &#8220;The something Hedgehog, wasn&#8217;t it&#8230;?&#8221; yes, he says confidently, &#8220;Elegance of the Hedgehog&#8221; with the iPhone under the table. </p>
<p>Of course, the reader wars are upon us, with <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000301301">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/iphone/">Barnes &amp; Noble&#8217;s</a> e-readers, among others, competing &#8211; on what, I don&#8217;t know. I did manage to read Robert Louis Stevenson&#8217;s <em>Treasure Island</em> on my iPhone via Stanza when my five-year-old lost interest in the hardcopy we were reading. But I&#8217;ve yet to be convinced that it&#8217;s worth paying for any books there besides maybe something to read in an emergency &#8211; you do know about reading emergencies, don&#8217;t you? </p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, despite the promise of e-readers, the so-called &#8220;long-tail&#8221; doesn&#8217;t yet exist. When the entire backlist of New Directions, Dalkey Archive and so on are available in the Kindle store, then maybe. </p>
<p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/shakespeareplay.png" width="259" height="176" style="float:right;margin-left:8px" /> Feel like brushing up on the play while waiting in line for your Shakespeare in the Park tickets? Read it on the free <a href="http://playshakespeare.com/news/3668-shakespeare-on-iphone-update?q=iphone">playshakespeare</a> app, a companion to the PlayShakespeare.com Website. You&#8217;re limited to only one version (First Folio of 1623 and the Globe Edition  of 1866), but it&#8217;s quite a comprehensive app and will leave you sifting through sonnets for hours on end. </p>
<p>On the margins of usefulness, there&#8217;s <a href="http://iphoneapps.oreilly.com/2009/07/next-read.html">Next Read</a> that allows you to keep lists of books and who recommended them. </p>
<p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/electroniclit_thumb.png" width="175" height="160" style="float:left;margin-right:8px" /> So many apps, many more I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know about, but I think one of the most interesting apps for the iPhone is one surely to help you out in a reading emergency: <a href="http://www.electricliterature.com/index.html">Electric Literature</a> is a lit-mag with versions in paper, Kindle, e-readers and the iPhone (although, unfortunately, the iPhone version is only for one issue, not a subscription). Short stories by authors you may or may or may not know at your finger tips. When carrying around the latest issue of <a href="http://www.brickmag.com/"><em>Brick</em></a> isn&#8217;t an option, you&#8217;ll find plenty to keep you busy with &#8220;Electric Literature.&#8221; The app doesn&#8217;t have all the bells and whistles of other e-readers, but it does have the one thing that&#8217;s paramount no matter what form&#8230;the text. </p>
