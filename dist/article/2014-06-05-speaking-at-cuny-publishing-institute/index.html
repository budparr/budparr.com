<p>For several years now, I’ve spoken annually at the <a href="http://cpi.journalism.cuny.edu/">CUNY Publishing Institute</a> run by John Oakes of <a href="http://orbooks.com/">OR Books</a>. Here’s a great article John wrote about the Institute for the <em>Journal of Electronic Publishing</em>: <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0017.208/--by-the-book-a-new-approach-to-teaching-the-art-of-book?rgn=main;view=fulltext">“By the Book: A New Approach to Teaching the Art of Book Publishing”</a>.</p>
