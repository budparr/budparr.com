   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/budparr/9257428&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is also available as a Gist on Github&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-markdown&quot;&gt;What is Markdown?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a great way to edit text so that your desired formatting is always intact no matter what editor you’re using. It’s increasingly used on the web as a way to ensure that a writer’s intended formatting never gets lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can edit Markdown files in any text editor, though there are are some, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iawriter.com/mac/&quot;&gt;iA Writer for Macs&lt;/a&gt;, that are specially built to make this easy way of writing even easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-i-write-in-markdown&quot;&gt;How do I write in Markdown?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown is extremely simple. In fact, it’s mostly plain text, so writing a paragraph would be the same as with any text editor (there’s a line between each paragraph).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to put in a line break&lt;br /&gt;
you merely put two spaces after a line&lt;br /&gt;
and it shows up like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;Emphasis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a word &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;, you merely put two asterisks around it:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;like **this**&lt;/code&gt; is  like &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To emphasize a word with &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt; you put one asterisk around it:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;like *this*&lt;/code&gt; is  like &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;use an _underscore_&lt;/code&gt; to get the same results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can even use these same characters to emphasize complete sentences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;links&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=markdown&quot;&gt;Links are simple&lt;/a&gt;. Just put the text to be linked in [] brackets, and the link in () parenthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Links are simple](https://www.google.com/search?q=markdown)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blockquotes&quot;&gt;Blockquotes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When typing an extended quote, just put the “greater than” sign before the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;gt; &quot;I have dipped into books of aesthetics, but I had an uncomfortable feeling that I was reading the works of astronomers who had never looked at the stars. They were writing about poetry as if poetry were a task, and not what it really is, a passion, and a joy.&quot;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I have dipped into books of aesthetics, but I had an uncomfortable feeling that I was reading the works of astronomers who had never looked at the stars. They were writing about poetry as if poetry were a task, and not what it really is, a passion, and a joy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lists&quot;&gt;Lists&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using Lists is Easy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just use a dash with a space before each line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Using Lists is Easy 
- Just use a dash with a space before each line
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;headings&quot;&gt;Headings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
# The largest heading  
## The second largest heading  
…
###### The 6th largest heading

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;images&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images are just like links, but they have an exclamation point in front of them (and of course the link should be to where the image is!). The text between the brackets becomes the title, but it’s not required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2835/12680465824_c959772b64_t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Images are easy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
![Images are easy](http://link-to-image.jpg)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re editing content in a Jekyll-based site, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://prose.io/&quot;&gt;prose editor&lt;/a&gt;, if your site is configured for it. If you want more advanced formatting, check out the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown site&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.github.com/overviews/mastering-markdown/&quot;&gt;Github Markdown page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Seeking Performance from your website? Skip the database</title>
   <link href="/article/2014/03/06/static-site-generators-introduction/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2014/03/06/static-site-generators-introduction</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2012 the developers for the Obama campaign moved from an ExpressionEngine-based website to serving static HTML pages generated by open source software called &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The success of that website, which was a model of performance and stability even with over 81 million page views, has set a movement afoot for web developers to utilize a more straightforward and less bloated technology stack than had become the norm over the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static site generators, like the one used by the Obama campaign, marry text documents and layout templates to generate HTML pages, which are then pushed to the server. There is no content management system and no database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of a “traditional” CMS driven website is a SQL database where all the site’s content and settings are organized into tables with rows and columns, much like a very complicated spreadsheet. Each CMS has its own scheme of organizing this information based on the perceived needs of its users and the system’s goals. On top of the database there is an application layer to convert the data into pages, route those pages into web addresses to serve to end users, and manage various user functions like inputing content through a WYSIWYG editor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of looking up data in a table to convert to a web page is time consuming, yet is typically done only at the point that a reader visits a web page. This added time, which, even measured in seconds, is detrimental to the user’s experience, particularly on mobile devices.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Many websites cache (save pre-rendered web pages in memory) to speed up the process, though that tends to only add a another layer of complexity rather than solve the original problem.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional MySQL databases not only tend to cause performance bottlenecks but are entry points for hacking, and are difficult to maintain in a version control system, and act as a barrier to moving content from one system to another. Even free open source systems come at a great cost of maintenance and hosting at scale as well as reliance on a variety of add-on developers that is costly over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to suggest that database driven websites are inherently bad in all cases, there are gains to be had by bypassing databases and focusing on content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;simplicity&quot;&gt;Simplicity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Balter, Github Gov 2.0 Evangelist and former Presidential Innovation Fellow, calls this the “Post-CMS” world&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and I believe he’s right, to a degree. Solutions such as Jekyll or other “static site generators” (there are many) are not content management systems because they only process files, or convert documents and templates into HTML pages. However, it’s only the database and system of application layers that is missing. What we are left with for “content management” is a set of files in folders, much like what we are all used to using on a day-to-day basis, replacing that concept with “document management.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the real world we organize our little bits of data into spreadsheets and our text in documents, yet in the world of CMS driven websites we lump all of our documents as though they were bits of data into spreadsheet-like rows, which in turn creates a separation between us and our content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what a document might look like in a static site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- - -&lt;br /&gt;
title: Title&lt;br /&gt;
category: Category&lt;br /&gt;
layout: article&lt;br /&gt;
date: November 10, 2013&lt;br /&gt;
author: authorname&lt;br /&gt;
- - -&lt;br /&gt;
content goes here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a text document that can be moved or shared with ease. In a database driven website the information above may be separated into as many as three or four different tables. While a highly organized database isn’t inherently wrong, document-based templating systems maintain the connection between the creator of the content and the resulting document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cost-effectiveness--faster-iterations&quot;&gt;Cost Effectiveness &amp;amp; Faster Iterations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static sites don’t require as complex web server setups so are much cheaper to host. In fact, depending on the circumstances, they can be hosted for free on &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github’s Pages&lt;/a&gt; service, which tightly ties their version control with the site’s hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of a website that was originally planned to be on a commercial CMS then moved to static is the information portal of healthcare.gov (not the problematic back-end application). This website has over a thousand pages organized for various users and was built with the same tools as the Obama campaign website. As a result of the move from a CMS to static, the site’s server requirements went from 32 servers down to one.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of rigidity in developing sites without a CMS make changes much faster to put into effect. The ease of version control also makes it such that a developer or developers anywhere can contribute to the site’s development and a site can easily be “forked,” that is copied for use on another site, in a matter of minutes. The entire website can be treated as an open source project (it can also be kept private in this set up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary of Benefits
The primary benefits of using static sites generators are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cost effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;faster iterations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;relative simplicity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;replicability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Me, The Summer Vacation Reading Issue</title>
   <link href="/article/2013/08/15/the-summer-vacation-reading-issue/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2013/08/15/the-summer-vacation-reading-issue</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;FINALLY. Vacation. Long overdue and a chance to catch up on some reading. Here’s what I’m taking to the beach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guy Davenport Reader&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve read &lt;em&gt;Geographies of the Imagination&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Table of Green Fields&lt;/em&gt;, which is incomprehensibly wonderful,  so this looks like an irresistible collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypothermia&lt;/em&gt;, by Álvaro Enrigue. I’ve been waiting a long time for this collection, since reading Enrigue’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/on-the-death-of-the-author&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Death of the Author&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at Words Without Borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawthorne &amp;amp; Child&lt;/em&gt;, by Keith Ridgway. I’m going in blind on this. The publisher (my client) is enthusiastic about it and there’s a blurb by Zadie Smith that says it’s “idiosyncratic” and another blurb that says that it’s “unpredictable.” Sounds good to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Infatuations&lt;/em&gt;, by Javier Marías. I often say that I never recommend Marías to anyone because you have to have a special patience for his writing (e.g. five minute scenes stretching out 80 pages or more), but I love his work, having read the &lt;em&gt;Your Face Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; trilogy and several other works of his (&lt;em&gt;A Heart So White&lt;/em&gt; being another fave). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that’s it. I’ve been perusing a few things to take along but haven’t settled on anything. I wish there were a Bolaño I haven’t read. I’ll also be finishing up &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, which I’ve been reading with my son this year, though I have to take it slow because he gets upset if I get ahead of him, and he too is a grazer. I used to read a Shakespeare play every summer, but I think I have enough on my plate and it always makes me talk funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I’m not a pulp beach reader. Vacation is one of the few times I can immerse myself in a bit of reading these days, so I hate to waste that time. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mixing Future and Past Dated Entries in Wordpress, with Date-based Filters</title>
   <link href="/article/2013/03/10/mixing-future-and-past-dated-entries-in-wordpress-with-date-based-filters/"/>
   <updated>2013-03-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2013/03/10/mixing-future-and-past-dated-entries-in-wordpress-with-date-based-filters</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We build web properties for publishers who are often promoting books that are not yet published. In Wordpress we treat the publish date of an entry as the publish date of the book. This presents a few problems in Wordpress showing yet-to-be-published entries, but we’ve been able to solve them with filters. Action hooks and filters are the most powerful feature of Wordpress, in my view. Used concisely and judiciously, they give you great control over how your content is displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a recent project for &lt;a href=&quot;http://blpress.org&quot;&gt;Bellevue Literary Press&lt;/a&gt; we wanted to display the client’s books mixed in various ways based on the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have room for 9 books total in 3 locations.   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location #1 shows 1 book: the most recently published.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location #2 shows 2 books, recently published, not including the book displayed in location #1 (solved with a simple “‘offset’ =&amp;gt; 1”)  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location #3 show up to 6 books, if there are any, that will be published in the next 7 months.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location #3 - If there are fewer than 6 books that meet the criteria in previous rule, then, and only then, we want to show the most recently published books that were not included in locations #1 or 2  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4051&quot; alt=&quot;Bellevue-Literary-Press-_-Bellevue-Literary-Press&quot; src=&quot;http://budparr.com/assets/img/uploads/2013/03/Bellevue-Literary-Press-_-Bellevue-Literary-Press.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;758&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two locations are handled simply with an offset rule, so we’ll skip to location 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, create a function to define our date filter*:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function filter_where( $where = &#39;&#39; ) {
// posts from X to Y days 
   $where .= &quot; AND post_date &amp;amp;gt;= &#39;&quot; . date(&#39;Y-m-d&#39;, strtotime(&#39;0 days&#39;)) . &quot;&#39;&quot; . &quot;
               AND post_date &amp;amp;lt;= &#39;&quot; . date(&#39;Y-m-d&#39;, strtotime(&#39;210 days&#39;)) . &quot;&#39;&quot;;
     return $where;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of this function gives me a bit of flexibility because when I wrote the code for this section I didn’t know what the specific time constraints would be. You can google for other ways to set your date parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply the function in a filter just before our query:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;source: Filter Reference/posts_where](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/posts_where)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;add_filter( &#39;posts_where&#39;, &#39;filter_where&#39; );

$books_forthcoming_args = array(
       &#39;post_type&#39; =&amp;amp;gt; &#39;product&#39;,
       &#39;posts_per_page&#39; =&amp;amp;gt; 6,
       &#39;orderby&#39; =&amp;amp;gt; &#39;date&#39;,
       &#39;order&#39; =&amp;amp;gt; &#39;asc&#39;,
       &#39;meta_key&#39; =&amp;amp;gt; &#39;_thumbnail_id&#39;,
        &#39;post_status&#39; =&amp;amp;gt; &#39;future&#39;
               ) ;
 $books_forthcoming = new WP_Query( $books_forthcoming_args );

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;aside: note that I wanted to only show books that had a thumbnail image, so added “‘meta_key’ =&amp;gt; ‘_thumbnail_id’,” to my parameters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do a little math:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$forthcoming_count = $books_forthcoming-&amp;amp;gt;post_count;
$books_remaining = 6 - $forthcoming_count;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first line gives me a count of the results in the $books_list query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second line gives me my count of the total number of books I want to show, less the number of books I am showing with this query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I needed to manipulate my header based on results, so add this sort of rule to header:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;h3&amp;amp;gt;Recent&amp;amp;lt;?php if ( $forthcoming_count &amp;amp;gt; 0 ){ echo &#39; &amp;amp;amp; Forthcoming&#39;; } ?&amp;amp;gt; Titles&amp;amp;lt;/h3&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;strong style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&amp;gt;Display posts in the usual fashion, then remove filter**

remove_filter( &#39;posts_where&#39;, &#39;filter_where&#39; );  

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up the second query using our $books_remaining variable to determine the number of books to show.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     $books_recent_args = array(
     &#39;posts_per_page&#39; =&amp;amp;gt; $books_remaining,
     &#39;offset&#39; =&amp;amp;gt; 3,
     &#39;orderby&#39; =&amp;amp;gt; &#39;date&#39;,
     &#39;order&#39; =&amp;amp;gt; &#39;desc&#39;,
     &#39;post_status&#39; =&amp;amp;gt; &#39;publish&#39;
     );

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>This is How Stories are Told Today</title>
   <link href="/article/2013/02/04/this-is-how-stories-are-told-today/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2013/02/04/this-is-how-stories-are-told-today</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve often thought that if I were going to an MFA writing program I’d also study filmmaking. It’s not that I don’t value text - I do, wholeheartedly. But, there are a lot of stories, not necessarily feature films, that can be told as well or better with video. The famous/infamous critic Leslie Fiedler said that a masterpiece is a work that transcends its medium. His prime example was “Gone with the Wind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a perfect example for a short story being told with video. This short is based off of a story by Etgar Keret, a favorite writer of mine. His style of writing is well suited to this transcendence because he has a way of honing what he wants to the point of brilliant concision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short was played at the Sundance Film Festival, and it’s terrific:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Quartz and the New The New Republic</title>
   <link href="/article/2013/01/29/quartz-and-the-new-the-new-republic/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2013/01/29/quartz-and-the-new-the-new-republic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We’re going to see myriad new redesigns of magazine and newspaper websites as the landscape shifts online. I’ve been studying some of these and am working on forming educated opinions. I’m very much enamored with &lt;a href=&quot;http://qz.com/&quot;&gt;_Quartz’s&lt;/a&gt; design (it’s not a redesign, but a new publication). Everything makes sense to me: immediately hitting readers with something to read, and nary a pixel wasted. The site’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design&quot;&gt;reponsiveness&lt;/a&gt; is superb, simply because they must have designed mobile first, something that is more difficult than it may seem. However, this tablet-centric design is not for everyone. &lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt; is streaming news, so their design is unique to the problems of presenting a lot of news to an audience with a short attention span.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/qz-com.png&quot; alt=&quot;Quartz&quot; /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newrepublic.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Republic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just days ago relaunched their website and iPad app. They’re solving a different problem: engaging readers now while still interesting them in subscription only content or products. The home page feels like a print magazine cover; dramatic, positively retro and low information density. One wonders if the cover will be “art-directed” each month, though I’d wager given the publisher’s pedigree that they will be testing and adjusting at the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/tnr-home.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting about the &lt;em&gt;TNR&lt;/em&gt; design is the article page. Elements shared with one of my other favorite content designs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, are centered text with a large font. &lt;em&gt;TNR&lt;/em&gt; is using 16px “Publico Text” (interestingly there doesn’t appear to be a font stack for &lt;em&gt;TNR&lt;/em&gt;. oversight, or the way embedded fonts need to work?), which is about 20% smaller than Medium’s 20px (measured, roughly, by cap height) and a generous line height, slightly less than Medium’s. While I think Medium really nails typography, &lt;em&gt;TNR&lt;/em&gt; does pretty good, compared, for example, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2013/01/29/rim-prepares-to-launch-new-blackberry-for-the-hyper-connected/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which flubs the type on article pages by not venturing past Georgia (not the worst thing) and not getting line height right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s lots going on here besides type. You may not notice at first, but there’s a progress bar up top. This is something that readers may soon come to expect. This one is subtle enough to be useful yet not get in the way of reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone at &lt;em&gt;TNR&lt;/em&gt; was brave enough not to pack article pages with all the garbage we’re used to seeing at the NYTimes.com. There are side-notes to the right. I love these, though not the link color, which I think directs to much attention to itself. Features like sharing, type-size adjustment and audio buttons are up top. Those buttons move to the top of the screen when the reader scrolls the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it’s not a design feature, cross-device syncing of articles will also be something that readers will soon come to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t particularly care for stark white backgrounds for reading, but I suppose that’s just a matter of preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s a successful imprint of the new publisher. The home page is an interesting and needed departure, though it remains to be seen if this particular style will be successful with readers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Like Literature more than Books, so Damn Me</title>
   <link href="/article/2012/11/17/i-like-literature-more-than-books-so-damn-me/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2012/11/17/i-like-literature-more-than-books-so-damn-me</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a cross-post of my comment on Andrew Piper’s article on Slate: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/11/reading_on_a_kindle_is_not_the_same_as_reading_a_book.single.html&quot;&gt;“Out of Touch - E-reading isn’t reading.”&lt;/a&gt; Piper says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I no longer pause over the slight caress of the almost turned page—a rapture of anticipation—I just whisk away.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is sentimental and anti-intellectual. What would Dostoyevsky, for instance, say if he heard that his words meant so little without some trifling material satisfaction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Tim Parks points out at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/feb/15/ebooks-cant-burn/&quot;&gt;New York Review of Books&lt;/a&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The e-book, by eliminating all variations in the appearance and weight of the material object we hold in our hand and by discouraging anything but our focus on where we are in the sequence of words (the page once read disappears, the page to come has yet to appear) would seem to bring us closer than the paper book to the essence of the literary experience. Certainly it offers a more austere, direct engagement with the words appearing before us and disappearing behind us than the traditional paper book offers, giving no fetishistic gratification as we cover our walls with famous names. It is as if one had been freed from everything extraneous and distracting surrounding the text to focus on the pleasure of the words themselves. In this sense the passage from paper to e-book is not unlike the moment when we passed from illustrated children’s books to the adult version of the page that is only text. This is a medium for grown-ups.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mr. Piper’s assertion here is inexcusable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;And as one study after another affirms, the more time we spend reading screens, the less time we spend reading individual units of the text. Skimming is the new normal.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies are about reading on the web in general, not strictly books, and to suggest otherwise indicates some sort of reaching for evidence that doesn’t exist. I would certainly like to see the studies (study after study!) that indicates that reading books on a screen causes one to skim. Reading, in fact, is the new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the sentimentality of this article ignores is the reality books and reading face today. Ebooks represent an opportunity for access and choice. So many children around the world don’t have the luxury you describe, and literacy is - amazingly - a major issue around the world. Ebooks are helping to solve that problem. For many of us, ebooks allow us to fit in reading, or read things previously inaccessible. No longer do we have to choose the edition that happens to be available sitting on a shelf, or suffer small typography, or read a small book because we can’t take a large book with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one among ebook advocates - to my knowledge - condemning the printed book in any way. I would imagine the strongest proponents, like myself, have homes full of printed books. But we love reading above all and some historical notion of what reading is supposed to feel like seems merely silly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;xwuWQTeDRriYcdgfJ3AqVhXjapk4MmKB is an example of what one of my passwords looks like. I also use Google’s double authentification (which is a royal pain) for my gmail and work email accounts, and each of my passwords to public sites is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DO THIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, obviously, use a password manager. There are other ways, but if you are still hanging on to your dog/kid password or something else that seems unique to you but really isn’t it is time to change your ways. Nate Silver says you have a 92% chance of getting hacked*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the NY Times with some advice “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/technology/personaltech/how-to-devise-passwords-that-drive-hackers-away.html?src=me&amp;amp;ref=general&quot;&gt;How to Drive the Password Hackers Away&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thomas Pynchon’s work has just been released as e-books. That’s great news, but I’m disappointed that a full e-book catalog of a major writer wasn’t released with something more like the Pottermore model. I had hoped that Rowling’s approach had started a trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so much in flux I’d hate to be locked into a particular reader, which, by merely releasing as an ebook to be sold from various vendors forces me to do, now. And, there wasn’t any ‘buy them all’ option like you can do with Pottermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the announcement video:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How do you feel about publication in electronic form?</title>
   <link href="/article/2012/08/17/how-do-you-feel-about-publication-in-electronic-form/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2012/08/17/how-do-you-feel-about-publication-in-electronic-form</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;A. It’s great for me. That’s my attitude. I don’t write for the reader. I’m working for the text, the object coming into existence. It makes its demands. Then, like a child you’ve raised, it goes off into its business, not mine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a brief interview with the inimitable, infinitely intelligent 88 year-old, William H. Gass at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/a-champion-of-the-book-takes-to-the-ipad/&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt; on the publication of his iPad only book-length essay, &lt;em&gt;Abstractions Arrive: Having Been There All the Time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My long-held belief is that books in any form are all about the text so why shouldn’t they be in any form, or perhaps Mr. Gass is saying by his action that the form should suit the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, significantly, he makes a claim that may take a while to bear fruit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;What effect does the Internet have on serious novelists?&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;A. It frees up writers from their publishers. Novels are being squeezed out of the culture. On the Internet, you can have them in their full efflorescence. Anyone who wants them — all five or six of you — can have them. That will purify the writers. It will become plain that they are only writing to a select group. So if you’re going to do it, you’ll have to do it well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m running off to download &lt;em&gt;Abstractions Arrive: Having Been There All the Time &lt;/em&gt;because the only thing  I love more than that title is brining together two forms of art in one place, as well as the fact that his book &lt;em&gt;Reading Rilke - Reflections on the Problems of Translation&lt;/em&gt; is a personal favorite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Treesaver is Fabulous</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/11/12/treesaver-is-fabulous/"/>
   <updated>2010-11-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/11/12/treesaver-is-fabulous</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://treesaver.net/&quot;&gt;Treesaver&lt;/a&gt; is a new way of presenting narrative content that combines a website with the structure of an ebook that scales to whatever device it’s being viewed on. While this first example, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicintegrity.org/treesaver/tuna/&quot;&gt;Looting the Seas&lt;/a&gt;,” won’t be of interest to everyone, &lt;a href=&quot;http://readnomad.com/&quot;&gt;Nomad editions&lt;/a&gt; will also be launching with this format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a fair amount written about Treesaver already, so I’ll limit my comments to a couple of things. The execution is really well done. So many projects I’ve seen in the ebook space have an amateurish air to them, but this is really polished. But the remarkable thing is its scalability. It’s not just that the site gets smaller or bigger, but it’s the way that it actually scales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web developers have long grappled with the idea of “fluid” designs  - sites that change size with the size of the browser. I’ve never used the fluid design technique on my sites because they have a fatal flaw. Fluid designs tend to grow or shrink column sizes to fill the space of the viewport. To be readable, text needs to be scannable, that is, your eye needs to flow from one line to the next without having to stop and think about it. The width of the column needs to have a relationship with the size of the text or your eye loses the flow of the text. Treesaver uses a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/&quot;&gt;responsive&lt;/a&gt; design that keeps the columns of text at a proportionate size no matter the space. I find this terribly exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Making Ebooks is as Easy as Blogging: My Instapaper(book) on Paul Muldoon</title>

   <id>/article/2010/11/11/making-ebooks-is-as-easy-as-blogging-my-instapaper-book-on-paul-muldoon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/Internet_dog_pub-268x3001.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-949&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/Internet_dog_pub-268x3001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;On the internet nobody knows you&#39;re not a publisher&quot; width=&quot;268&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the not-distant future, the idea of a book or magazine will be much more fluid than it is today, partly because they are easier to produce than in the past, and partly because we will come to expect them to be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repackaging Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One wonders how many of the hundreds of thousands of books published every year are collections of work already published, such as stories or essays. What is the value in repackaging previously published material? Sometimes, like the case with short stories, they are inaccessible in their original form because they were published in many different journals of varying levels of availability. Also, putting a collection together gives the individual pieces some needed context or force of argument, as is the case with Alex Ross’s collection of essays, &lt;em&gt;Listen to This&lt;/em&gt;, bringing together Ross’s &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; articles that, so far as I can tell, aim specifically to bridge a gap between popular and classical music (there is one previously unpublished essay in the book). For a long time now professors have pulled together “books” of a variety of material for their students, and today you can put your own “book” together of Wikipedia articles with the click of a button (in PDF, OpenDocument Text, or Print-on-demand).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading Content Outside of its Original Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve become promiscuous with our nonfiction reading. Atomization began with RSS readers, which display content by date or topic, rather than just the source. Then, the swift change in the media environment drew lines (then blurred them) between writers and their publications. Now we read based on the recommendation of twitterers and “friends” rather than sitting down to our morning paper. Our sources might be chosen for a variety of reasons, not just the veneration of the package they came in. Apps like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flipboard.com/&quot;&gt;Flipboard&lt;/a&gt;, will further challenge our old reading habits. Interestingly, Instapaper - the online application that allows you to save articles to read later on your own device instead of its published source - gives publishers guidelines if they want their content to look its best through their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contexts Can Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that content takes on meaning  depending on how it is packaged and consumed, and no one publication will have a monopoly on either. In the same way that I know people because of common interest rather than physical proximity (primarily because of my online activities), I read not - necessarily - based on publication, but on interest. I may sit one night and read articles and blog posts on publishing, then read about technology, or literature from other sets of sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowd-Curation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the growing popularity of microblogs like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://posterous.com&quot;&gt;Posterous&lt;/a&gt;, we all become curators as well as consumers. While a microblog may be an on-the-fly mechanism, we’re also seeing an interest in long-form writing (crowd-curated by sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapaper.com/browse&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://longreads.com/&quot;&gt;Longreads&lt;/a&gt;). There’s no reason why that won’t turn into something more thoughtful where a body of essays or stories (perhaps collected from a site like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fictionaut.com/&quot;&gt;Fictionaut&lt;/a&gt;) are curated and shared by anyone with the knowledge or time to assemble them. There will be issues, to be sure. Rights and the potential to manipulate content are just a couple to reckon with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been fooling around with this idea in my head a bit. Books (or, broadly, publications) in any form are a vessel to focus our attention and to have some semblance of permanence, even if, as in the above examples, that is merely a matter of convenience or editorial choice. That much won’t change. What will change is the necessity for content to be emitted straight from a publisher’s hand to its final destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the end of thinking about this in practical, if somewhat crude, terms, I created an ebook of related articles. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapaper.com&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; to collect articles and it’s become my preferred environment for reading on the iPad, even though what I really enjoy is the book-like environment of reading in an ereader, like iBooks. Instapaper has a feature on its website that allows you to create an EPUB (among other formats) of your content. By putting articles into a folder you can create a specific theme or whatever grouping you like of articles. Instapaper isn’t meant to create books, necessarily, so this is a bit rough, and just for fun anyway; it’s a bit wanting for formatting. Naturally, I didn’t secure any reprint rights for the content, though everything is sourced and linked to from the book. It’s not for sale and for private use only and will be linked to from here unless someone gets angry and wants me to take it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Good Subject&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose Paul Muldoon because while reading his latest collection Maggot, I also wanted to read The Paris Review interview of him, thinking that I’d like to read it on my iPad so I can get to it on the train. So, despite having the original print version, I went to The Paris Review website, saved it to Instapaper, then thought I’d put together some other pieces to draw a more complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The articles in this collection begin with Muldoon’s Wikipedia entry, several biographical articles, reviews and interviews, culminating in The Paris Review interview from 2004. There’s no poetry in the book because I fear formatting could easily be screwed up (see my previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/2010/10/can-we-trust-poetry-ebooks-the-case-of-allen-ginsbergs-collected-poems/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on poetry formatting in EPUB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here it is, [&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/documents/Instapaper(book) - Introduction to Paul Muldoon.epub.zip&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Paul Muldoon&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just saw this video posted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citylights.com/&quot;&gt;City Lights&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook of a 1965 reading at Royal Albert Hall with 19 poets including Allen Ginsberg, who I think organized the event, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Andrei Voznesenski, Harry Fainlight, Ernst Jandl, William Burroughs, and Christopher Logue. It’s such a fantastic video if for nothing else the energy in the room. I’ve been to poetry readings in large halls with at least a couple thousand people, but this is more like a rock concert of poetry - there were reportedly 7,000 people there with the audience an active participant. Aside from some of the antics, my favorite reading is from Christopher Logue. Here’s an excerpt on Youtube and somebody posted a longer one on MySpace (but I can’t seem to embed that, but you should definitely click through and watch it all).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Makes a New Yorker?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_973” align=”alignleft” width=”300” caption=”The Literary Walk, Central Park”]&lt;a href=&quot;literary_walk_central_park_lg.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-973&quot; src=&quot;literary_walk_central_park_lg-300x226.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Literary Walk, Central Park&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard to believe it’s October, and funny to think that it was 16 years ago on Columbus Day that I moved to NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve lived on the Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Gramercy, Ft. Green and Carroll Gardens Brooklyn, and have spent an enormous amount of time in the West Village, where I also went to school at NYU, both undergraduate and graduate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve walked so many stretches of this city to see it as closely as possible. I buy my pickles on the Lower East Side. I shopped avidly at the old &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_Book_Mart&quot;&gt;Gotham Book Mart&lt;/a&gt; before that was more than a memory. I’ve been to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuyorican_Poets_Caf%C3%A9&quot;&gt;Nuyorican Poets Café&lt;/a&gt;, read on stage at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery_Poetry_Club&quot;&gt;Bowery Poetry Club&lt;/a&gt;, read a piece of my own at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB_(bar)&quot;&gt;KGB Bar&lt;/a&gt;, been to readings, lectures of all stripes, and held my own little debates in bars all over the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met my wife at The Gingerman on 36th St. Took her to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumley&#39;s&quot;&gt;Chumleys&lt;/a&gt; (the former speakeasy with the hidden entrance and signed photos of the literary who’s who of time past, that is sadly no longer) on our first date and to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquin_Round_Table&quot;&gt;storied&lt;/a&gt; Algonquin on our second.  We got engaged in Central Park (see photo), had our wedding rehearsal dinner at the restaurant in Bryant Park, and were married at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Arts_Club&quot;&gt;National Arts Club&lt;/a&gt; in Gramercy Park. We had three kids at NY Presbyterian Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked in the World Financial Center for Merill Lynch, spent much time at the World Trade Center, commuted to New Jersey, and after a major career change from Wall Street to technology, became part of the laptop in coffee shop revolution. I’ve had drinks or posh meals at the St. Regis and Cipriani’s; the top of the Chrysler building; stayed at The Plaza Hotel, when it was The Plaza Hotel. I’ve met or seen movie stars, royalty, diplomats and politicians. I’ve talked politics or books with some of the most incredibly bright minds one can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made money, gone broke, been unhappy then ecstatic. I’ve seen a lot, but nothing close to it all. Pretty much everything I am today is a result of being in NYC, yet to those who were born here, I’m not really a New Yorker. At least my three sons will be.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Can We Trust (Poetry) Ebooks? - The Case of Allen Ginsberg's Collected Poems</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/10/05/can-we-trust-poetry-ebooks-the-case-of-allen-ginsberg-s-collected-poems/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/10/05/can-we-trust-poetry-ebooks-the-case-of-allen-ginsberg-s-collected-poems</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As much as I love e-books, I wish publishers put more thought and effort into the design issues specific to them. From what I understand, most e-books published today come out of the same process as the print edition (something like, perhaps, Adobe InDesign) then &lt;strong&gt;exported&lt;/strong&gt; into EPUB or MOBI (happy to hear from anyone who can clarify this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a web designer/developer (there are many similarities between front-end web code and e-books), I’ve never trusted the export function of any application. They tend to spit out extraneous code and open up vast possibilities for errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, when the &lt;em&gt;Virginia Quarterly Review&lt;/em&gt; published an EPUB version of their book-like journal earlier this year, they took pains on the journal’s EPUB design, going so far as to “optimize” it for Apple’s iBook application. The results showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time publishers took a hard look at their workflow. Below are some examples. The first is a scan of a poem in Allen Ginsberg’s&lt;em&gt; Collected Poems 1947 - 1997&lt;/em&gt;. The e-book version was released today. I downloaded samples from three vendors/apps for the iPad: Apple’s iBook, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble’s Nook, and Amazon’s Kindle. I looked on Kobo but the book didn’t appear in their store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the print edition, scanned. Note the structure of the lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1020&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;770&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the Amazon Kindle edition. Text-size, color and pagination on all of these examples are variable, so should not be a final criteria. Note that the first line of every stanza is indented (this is on every poem, none of which are indented in the print edition). Also note that the line beginnings are completely different than the print edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_amazon_kindle.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1011&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_amazon_kindle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the Nook edition with the same problem with line beginnings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_bn_nook.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1017&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_bn_nook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again with Apple’s iBook version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_apple_ibook.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1014&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_apple_ibook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the poem is readable, nothing can be taken for granted in a poet’s intent. Poetry e-books also suffer from the problem of variability of font sizes. I did a similar exercise with Jorie Graham’s &lt;em&gt;Sea Change&lt;/em&gt;, which has long lines. Generally speaking, I’ve found line breaks to be okay, but making the font larger creates artificial line breaks and the degree of indentation is all over the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an inteview with &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/07/23/am-kindle-isnt-kind-to-poetry/&quot;&gt;American Public Media&lt;/a&gt;, former U.S. poet Laureate Billy Collins maintains that electronic reading devices (by which I think he means EPUB readers, generally) aren’t well suited to poetry*:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radke:&lt;/strong&gt; How did you find the meaning of your poetry changed on the screen?

&lt;strong&gt;Collins:&lt;/strong&gt; Well it wasn&#39;t so much the meaning, it was just that poetry comes in lines, like gaslone comes in gallons. If you wanted the name of the creature that is the poet, they are like homolinearium -- they&#39;re like line-making creatures.

&lt;strong&gt;Radke:&lt;/strong&gt; Haha, yes.

&lt;strong&gt;Collins:&lt;/strong&gt;And that&#39;s what we do, we make lines. Charles Olson, the poet, said no line must sleep, every line in a poem should be wakeful to the lines around it. And when you put a poem on a Kindle, the lines are broken in order to fit on the screen. And so instead of being the poet&#39;s decision, it becomes the device&#39;s decision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if there’s a solution to font-size problem, and I hope that we don’t come to accept lower standards for the sake of e-books. Will we be stuck with PDFs for poetry, or apps only?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*thanks to Alizah at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poetryfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;Poetry Foundation&lt;/a&gt; for the heads up on the Collins interview.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Note on Howl, the Movie</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/10/04/a-note-on-howl-the-movie/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/10/04/a-note-on-howl-the-movie</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A movie about a poem? Really? How does that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it helps if the poem was famous, and great, and had its own obscenity trial. It’s a nice reminder of how great the poem is, particularly when read aloud, and particularly in the face of the fact that there are still lots of places in this country where books are banned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is it good? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went during the day to spare my wife having to sit through a movie about a poem. I was on my own and nearly walked out of the theater several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So it’s bad?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not exactly. &lt;a href=&quot;http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/film/89268/howl-film-review&quot;&gt;Time Out New York&lt;/a&gt; panned it. That’s too bad. They panned James Franco’s reading too, saying he “did little more than mimic Ginsberg’s squeaky tenor cadences,” calling him “too hipster-primped by half.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought Franco’s reading was very good, the highlight of the film, along with the interview scenes  (based on actual records). Maybe the Time Out  reviewer is an expert, I don’t know, but I’ve read the poem myself, aloud, and I’ve listened to it read by Ginsberg what seems like a million times. The early recording [&lt;a href=&quot;http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Ginsberg/SFSU-1956/Ginsberg-Allen_04_Howl_SFSU_10-25-56.mp3&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;] of Ginsberg reading it isn’t great, but he does build momentum (and, seemingly, confidence) as he goes on, just as Franco did. A later recording, which is set to Lee Hyla’s string quartet, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000005J3N/qid=1077325102/sr=1-13/ref=sr_1_13/102-6487001-3036120?v=glance&amp;amp;s=classical&quot;&gt;Howl,&lt;/a&gt;” and recorded in, I think, 1994, is a more mature Ginsberg when he really had come into himself as a reader. It’s a great great reading. There’s a stark difference between the two. Franco’s reading is set when Ginsberg had just recently written it. His performance seems not only &lt;a href=&quot;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2010/09/james-franco-howl-aurally.html&quot;&gt;accurate&lt;/a&gt;, but to some degree transporting and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial segment was “good” (Don Draper playing John Hamm, playing Ferlinghetti’s attorney, Jake Ehrlich) and the flashback scenes were  ”okay” (I’m assuming that if you’re reading this, you’ve at least seen summaries or the film itself). The weaving of these elements I think was, nonetheless, a brilliant way to present the poem in film, largely letting it (and the record) speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what’s bad enough that you’d want to walk out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://ginsbergblog.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Allen Ginsberg Project &lt;/a&gt;calls the animation scenes “underappreciated.” I think they’re just an abomination. Granted, in any other context they’d be considered artful and accomplished, but I agree with A.O. Scott in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/movies/24howl.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;, who said…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is as if an earnest, literal-minded undergraduate had set out to illustrate “Howl” without understanding the essential difference between poetic and pictorial imagery, a distinction that was hardly lost on Ginsberg, a gifted photographer who counted William Blake among his crucial influences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were utterly distracting, so much so I wanted to hide my eyes, or worse, just leave the theater. They were jolting as though an ad or different movie had come on suddenly, and of course, they were insulting to the poem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the trailer below. There’s probably a reason you don’t see the animations much. Maybe one day there will be a &lt;em&gt;people’s&lt;/em&gt; cut with a blank screen over those scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also see the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://ginsbergblog.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Allen Ginsberg Project&lt;/a&gt;” blog for links to a host of other opinions. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.litkicks.com/HowlTheMovie&quot;&gt;Levi likes the animations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Will Magazine iPad Apps Go the Way of the 8-track?</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/09/30/will-magazine-ipad-apps-go-the-way-of-the-8-track/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/09/30/will-magazine-ipad-apps-go-the-way-of-the-8-track</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0009.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-364&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0009-300x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Love the new &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; iPad app. If I could have it as a subscription like I have for the print version (which I think I pay $25/yr for), I would certainly buy it, knowing that I’d never have to rip out another article to stick in my pocket as I run out of the house, and confident that I’d never wonder where ‘that’ article was I started a week ago and couldn’t find. Digital trumps print hands down for periodicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; app, like most all the magazine apps available now, is visually appealing. The ads are attractive yet not terribly distracting. The navigation is infinitely better than print, as well as the integrated video or audio content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, stepping back, magazine publishers are falling well short of the promise of the magical device they’re publishing on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_366” align=”alignright” width=”225” caption=”National Geographic iPad app image broken up”]&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0007.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-366&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0007-225x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something’s missing. Dynamism, to start. A replica of a printed magazine doesn’t feel very dynamic because it’s not. In fact, it appears to be only a step above Zinio magazines (whom, I assure you, if they don’t innovate, will be in the graveyard soon because they really are nothing more than a replica of a print magazine and no better than a pdf file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ain’t going to cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to be a complainer. Really. If there were a good subscription model for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; iPad app, I would subscribe and bide time until it got better. I’d much rather read digital than print (on a dedicated device, that is, not a laptop) and I think everyone will in fairly short order as tablets and e-readers continue their march into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the fanfare of the common magazine app signals a march into digital with little more than lip service to the great potential for magazines. Here are a few observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_368” align=”alignleft” width=”225” caption=”The New Yorker app full page navigation”]&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0004.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-368&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0004-225x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Navigation is all over the place right now.  Some apps swipe right to left to go to a new page in an article - like a print magazine - and some scroll down - like a Website. Navigation from article to article is either a swipe or a tap  or a scroll to find other articles. The full page navigation is marginally helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where apps can learn from print. All print magazines I know of are consistent in the way one turns a page: a ‘swipe’. It’s nice not to confound expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_374” align=”alignright” width=”225” caption=”MacLife app (with navigation drawer open) has small print that&#39;s not zoomable.”]&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0008.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-374&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0008-225x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) What e-pub (&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/2010/06/vqr-is-the-smartest-magazine-on-the-planet-and-has-embraced-the-future-of-magazines/&quot;&gt;my favorite format for magazines&lt;/a&gt;) does so nicely is to let readers determine their own optimal text size. Images of magazines in an app are static and you can’t even zoom in on them like you can with a web page on an iPad. Some are not bad. The New Yorker is readable despite choosing an unfriendly typeface in hopes - I suppose - of making long-time subscribers feel comfortable. But, the &lt;em&gt;MacLife&lt;/em&gt; app (which also forgets your place when you leave the app, &lt;em&gt;grrr&lt;/em&gt;) has small type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; app (powered by Zinio) is a hybrid in this regard. While flipping through the replica of the magazine, you are instructed to tap on a button to read the text. Doing so, you are given a text only version of the article (tada! flexible font-sizes). I’ve been reading &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; off and on since I was a kid. I would never. I mean NEVER have read text-only versions of their articles. Photographs are the heart of the magazine, and to separate the two because you know your replica of a magazine is unreadable otherwise is an inexcusable failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gourmet Magazine’s&lt;/em&gt; app, &lt;em&gt;Gourmet Live&lt;/em&gt;, which I think is a hybrid, web-based app, does allow for font-size changes, though it’s overall article design is linear, blog post-like and generally poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Magazines in the digital age should publish on a continuum. Like the feeds of blogs (and magazines) I read in my feed-reader, I want new articles to magically appear in my reading device (in real-time). In fact, I don’t think magazines should publish issues at all. While some magazines, like &lt;em&gt;Current History&lt;/em&gt;, publish thematically, many are merely time-based, like &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, and must realize that an “issue” is a term that should be filed away with “print.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_370” align=”alignleft” width=”150” caption=”I won! A related article I get for completing (scrolling through, at least) the last article. “]&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0005.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-thumbnail wp-image-370&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0005-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streams of articles can be published when they are ready. The New Yorker already has follow up blog posts to articles on their website. In the app, those posts should be part of the article, as well as pertinent metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to see magazines pull in related concepts or articles. The &lt;em&gt;Gourmet Live&lt;/em&gt; app does this, though I don’t care for the “game” aspect, or the fact that I can’t do anything with it until I’ve registered (the social-media centric kids who must have designed the app assume that everyone using it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; surely have a Facebook or Twitter account to log in with, creating yet one more barrier to using their product). However, I really admire the concept of actively involving users, though I think - as unsexy as it sounds - a table of related articles or a way to save articles in an iTunes-like format might be more helpful. I do think the &lt;em&gt;Gourmet Live&lt;/em&gt; app is the smartest I’ve seen and one to watch for how it improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, this is a bit of a rant - constructive, hopefully - but I think it’s worth questioning if “apps” are even the right medium for magazines. Apps can be ported from device to device, but without a standard format your magazine is that much more likely to disappear as devices come and go. Epub is a standard, it’s flexible and accessible on a wide variety of devices. I think more energy should be put into making good magazines in a format that allows for dynamism and fluidity, and can fit into a library or some file system, and skip the sexy features. Publishers should think in terms of all the ways each and every piece of content can be distributed instead shoehorning old concepts into hot new devices. Don’t let the tail (devices) wag the dog, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just love this, particularly since I remember hearing that Dylan was playing at the White House and thinking to myself, what the hell is Bob Dylan doing at the White House? This is President Obama talking about that event with The Rolling Stone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Here&#39;s what I love about Dylan: He was exactly as you&#39;d expect he would be. He wouldn&#39;t come to the rehearsal; usually, all these guys are practicing before the set in the evening. He didn&#39;t want to take a picture with me; usually all the talent is dying to take a picture with me and Michelle before the show, but he didn&#39;t show up to that. He came in and played &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&#39;.&quot; A beautiful rendition. The guy is so steeped in this stuff that he can just come up with some new arrangement, and the song sounds completely different. Finishes the song, steps off the stage — I&#39;m sitting right in the front row — comes up, shakes my hand, sort of tips his head, gives me just a little grin, and then leaves. And that was it — then he left. That was our only interaction with him. And I thought: That&#39;s how you want Bob Dylan, right? You don&#39;t want him to be all cheesin&#39; and grinnin&#39; with you. You want him to be a little skeptical about the whole enterprise. So that was a real treat.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the entire article at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/209395?RS_show_page=0&quot;&gt;The Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Obama fans will love every word, I did.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Craftsmanship</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/09/22/craftsmanship/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/09/22/craftsmanship</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We recently watched the documentary “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notebynotethemovie.com/&quot;&gt;Note by Note: The Making of Steinway L1037&lt;/a&gt;” and the whole family enjoyed it. I only wanted to see it because I love music and the mystique that instruments hold, but I wasn’t really expecting what the story was really about: Craftsmanship, painstaking, minute, detailed craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film follows a Steinway concert grand over the course of the year it takes to make it, from the forest trees where its wood comes from, to the factory in Queens where its created, to its place on the Steinway showroom where pianists will first develop their relationship with it. Over the course of the journey the film is dominated by interviews with the piano’s makers as well as some well known musicians who use Steinways. This juxtaposition of the makers and users is really the crux of the film. Both are lovingly dedicated to their art to a rarified degree, but aside from their passion what’s remarkable is the cause and effect the filmmakers draw out. The sixteenth of an inch cut or quality of a particular sheet of wood, the tolerances and exactitude of the placement of each key, these factors emerge as a piano’s personality through its creation. The musicians respond with great affection to one piano or another, as in one scene followed Pierre-Laurent Aimard looking for a “monster.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subtext of the film is that this sort of craftsmanship is dying. Where once their were hundreds of piano makers, now there are few, and there seemed to be some question of finding people in the future who might be willing to do this sort of work. Fortunately the film didn’t dwell there at all and instead celebrated the magnificence of these instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, we just bought an electric piano for our family. It’s a very nice piano (not a keyboard, but a full-fledged piano) and it probably sounds as good as any spinet we could afford (seriously, it sounds great). What it might lack in elegance and beauty it makes up for in utility in a family of five where three boys will be going through piano lessons, banging away at the keyboard for years to come. We can play it as though it’s an organ or piano, and if we wished any number of other configurations. My wife is an avid pianist and she loves that she can turn the volume down and play at night, or put on headphones, which make it sound even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, there’s a sense of technology trumping craftsmanship. The ambivalence I feel about such matters - the fear of loss of things made with love, while at the same time enjoying the enabling affect of technology, is something that I hope never goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a clip from the film:&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you sat horrified as Colin Powell so obviously lied to the world about WMDs in Iraq back in 2003, you knew there was a heavy dose of politics at work there. Making explicit what we more or less understood, Fulton Armstrong, a former U.S. Intelligence Officer, writes, in a letter to the editor of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/aug/19/cia-and-wmds-damning-evidence/?pagination=false&quot;&gt;The New York Review of Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we on the National Intelligence Council finally got a full read of the National Intelligence Estimate on WMDs, after its publication, a couple of us expressed grave reservations about the fatally weak evidence and the obsessively one-sided interpretation of what shreds of information it contained. (We were not told at the time that “Curveball” was a solitary source of obviously questionable credentials, nor that contradictory evidence was actually suppressed from the intelligence collection and dissemination process.) One colleague said it was clearly a paper written to provide a rationale for a predetermined policy decision to go to war. When I challenged the lack of evidence and the lack of alternative explanations, including forcing the questions raised by the INR into a lowly footnote, one of the WMD-promoting NIOs leaned forward and bellowed: “Who are you to question this paper? Even &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; agree with us.” The irony was complete: previously respected reporters, spoon-fed by Bush administration officials, were now being used to provide cover for the NIOs’ similar compromise in accepting the administration’s view.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Powers, who wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/may/27/how-they-got-their-bloody-way/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; (about a book by Robert Jervis on the topic), replies, beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fulton Armstrong’s important letter states as fact something Americans have been resisting for sixty years—that presidents tell the CIA not only what to do, but what to say. By Americans I do not mean only ordinary citizens puzzling over intelligence flaps every few years, but observers thought to be sophisticated, like professors, senators of long experience, foreign policy professionals, and reporters for serious newspapers. Armstrong describes the reality about as plainly as I have ever seen it done in his letter explaining the source of error in the CIA’s insistently wrong estimate of the progress of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in its purported effort to develop weapons of mass destruction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One takeaway from this exchange (upon reading it in its entirety ) is that not much has changed in terms of the underlying problems. Whenever I begin to think I should be less cynical about politics and the media, I come across something like this. Cynicism never goes out of style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Read the rest of the letter at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/aug/19/cia-and-wmds-damning-evidence/?pagination=false&quot;&gt;The New York Review of Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;

   <title>Make it New, or At Least Know that You're Not: The Problem with MFAs</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;

Having no vested interest in MFA programs or the &#39;state of fiction,&#39; I was free to be amused by Elif Batuman&#39;s fairly far reaching article in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n18/elif-batuman/get-a-real-degree#fn-ref-asterisk&quot;&gt;London Review of Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; taking Mark McGurl to task for his defense of MFA programs. The setup is this: Batufman is a PhD and McGurl is a PhD discussing what I suspect is regarded as a rather lowly space in academia - which explains why terms like &quot;intradiegetic-homodiegetic narration&quot; seem to me out of place. Nonetheless, the essay touches on the serious subject of the affect MFA programs have on generations of writers and what we as readers come to expect of them.

In his book &lt;em&gt;The Programme Era: Postwar Fiction and the Rise of Creative Writing&lt;/em&gt;, McGurl takes what I think is the minority position defending the MFA, saying that programme writing has produced &quot;as rich and multifaceted a body of literary writing as has ever been.&quot; Batufman is rightly critical of him and the programmes - admitting from the outset that she&#39;s no fan of the writing that comes out of them - but comes off, in the beginning, amusingly pedantic by pointing out the historical precedents of this or that sort of writing that McGurl left out. She says &quot;It might not be true that you have to ‘know the rules before you can break them’, but knowing the rules can save you from certain pitfalls, like thinking you’re being revolutionary when you aren’t.&quot;

Her point, I think, is something that I know anecdotally to be true, that MFA students don&#39;t read and don&#39;t have a sense of precedent, the affect of which is stultifying. She says...
&lt;blockquote&gt;I think of myself as someone who prefers novels and stories to non-fiction; yet, for human interest, skilful storytelling, humour, and insightful reflection on the historical moment, I find the average episode of &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; to be 99 per cent more reliable than the average new American work of literary fiction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Don&#39;t laugh that comment off, because I think there&#39;s a lot of validity to it, though I wish she wouldn&#39;t have brought &quot;Reality Hunger&quot; in the essay (if only because of exhaustion). MFA programs serve a great purpose - essentially professionalizing fiction writing - but they are not where the best writing is coming from. Yet...
&lt;blockquote&gt;McGurl has an explanation for why programme writing seems so unexciting and unspecial. It’s a weird explanation. ‘As with the disappearance of the .400 hitter in professional baseball’, so technical excellence has produced an ‘optical illusion of encroaching mediocrity: being the dominant figure in Shakespeare’s or even Pound’s time was, by comparison to today, easy as pie’. In other words, the programme era has produced so many books as good as &lt;em&gt;The Red and the Black&lt;/em&gt; that we don’t notice them anymore.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I find this, as Batufman does, implausible, but I don&#39;t think the answer is, as she seems to imply, only having PhD programs for literature because MFA doesn&#39;t provide enough grounding.

At any rate, that&#39;s just my bit, but read the whole terrific essay at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n18/elif-batuman/get-a-real-degree#fn-ref-asterisk&quot;&gt;LRB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;because there&#39;s much more depth there&lt;em&gt;. A&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal&quot;&gt;nd  check out Batufman&#39;s &lt;/span&gt;The Possessed&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal&quot;&gt;. I haven&#39;t picked it up yet, but it came very highly recommended to me by someone who really ought to know. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

   <title>Where We Find Music, 0.1</title>

   <updated>2010-08-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/08/24/where-we-find-music-0-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The movie “Nine” is based on a play that is in turn based on the film “8 1/2.” Despite an all-star cast led by Daniel Day-Lewis and a stunningly beautiful production it manages to fall flat on its face. If one wanted a film example of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robkapilow.com/wmigreat.shtml&quot;&gt;“What Makes it Great”&lt;/a&gt; with a bastard interpretation of an earlier great work, this is it. “Nine” is a perfectly soulless film. Avoid except for medicinal purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one good thing came of an otherwise wasted evening. While searching around to see if I was the only one who loathed “Nine,” I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091223/REVIEWS/912239996&quot;&gt;Roger Ebert’s&lt;/a&gt; review and learned this bit that I missed by not going to film school (or, whatever):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fellini&#39;s great films are essentially musicals. Like most Italian directors of his generation, he didn&#39;t record live dialogue and sound. He depended on dubbing. On a set, he usually had an orchestra playing, and asked his actors to move, not in time with the music, but &quot;in sympathy.&quot; Everyone in a Fellini film evokes an inner body rhythm. Then there&#39;s Rota&#39;s music itself, my favorite soundtracks. I could watch a Fellini film on the radio.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes perfect sense now that I know it, and nowhere would the concept be more clear than in “8 1/2.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Joyce to Ibsen, 1901</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/06/16/joyce-to-ibsen-1901/"/>
   <updated>2010-06-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/06/16/joyce-to-ibsen-1901</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;James Joyce wrote to Henrik Ibsen when Joyce was nineteen years old and Ibsen in his seventies and at the end of his career. Joyce had managed to publish a review —his very first formal publication — of Ibsen’s play &lt;em&gt;When We Dead Awaken&lt;/em&gt; a year earlier and, to his great surprise, Ibsen responded: “I have read or rather spelled out a review in &lt;em&gt;The Fortnightly Review&lt;/em&gt; by Mr James Joyce which is very benevolent and for which I should greatly like to thank the author if only I had sufficient knowledge of the language.” This began a three year correspondence between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Joyce’s biographer Richard Ellmann, Ibsen’s response “fell upon him like a benison at the beginning of his career. He had entered the world of literature under the best auspices in that world…Before Ibsen’s letter Joyce was an Irishman; after it he was a European.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time Joyce had been writing, but it was well before he published any of his own work of fiction, poetry or drama. Ibsen’s influence is clear in &lt;em&gt;Portrait&lt;/em&gt;, yet in an earlier essay “Drama and Life” and the following letter it appears that Ibsen’s influence is as an artist as well. Understanding Joyce’s view of himself as an “artist” is critical to reading his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”…the artist forgoes his very self and stands a mediator in awful truth before the veiled face of God.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joyce translated his own words from English to Norwegian. Here is the letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;To Henrik Ibsen
March 1901

&lt;em&gt;8 Royal Terrace, Fairfield, Dublin &lt;/em&gt;

Honoured Sir: I write to you to give you greeting on your seventy-third birthday and to join my voice to those of your well-wishers in all lands. You may remember that shortly after the publication of your latest play, &lt;em&gt;When We Dead Awaken&lt;/em&gt;, an appreciation of it appeared in one of the English Reviews — &lt;em&gt;The Fortnightly Review&lt;/em&gt; — over my name. I know that you have seen it because some short time afterwards Mr William Archer wrote to me and told me that in a letter he had had from you some days before, you had written, &#39;I have read or rather spelled out a review in &lt;em&gt;The Fortnightly Review&lt;/em&gt; by Mr James Joyce which is very benevolent and for which I should greatly like to thank the author if only I had sufficient knowledge of the language.&#39; (My own knowledge of your language is not, as you see, great but I trust you will be able to decipher my meaning.) I can hardly tell you how moved I was by your message. I am a young, very young man, and perhaps the telling of such tricks of the nerves will make you smile. But I am sure if you go back along your own life to the time when you were an undergraduate at the University as I am, and if you think what it would have meant to you to have earned a word from one who held as high a place in your esteem as you hold in mine, you will understand my feeling. One thing only I regret, namely, that an immature and hasty article should have met your eye rather than something better and worthier of your praise. There may not have been any wilful stupidity in it, but truly I can say no more. It may annoy to you to have your works at the mercy of striplings but I am sure you would prefer hotheadedness to nerveless and &#39;cultured&#39; paradoxes.

What shall I say more? I have sounded your name defiantly through the college where it was either unknown of known faintly and darkly. I have claimed for you your rightful place in the history of drama. I have shown what, as it seemed to me, was your highest excellence — your lofty impersonal power. Your minor claims — your satire, your technique and orchestral harmony — these, too, I advanced. Do not think me a hero-worshipper — I am not so. And when I spoke of you in debating societies and so forth, I enforced attention by no futile ranting.

But we always keep the dearest things to ourselves. I did not tell them what bound me closest to you. I did not say how what I could discern dimly of your life was my pride to see, how your battles inspired me — not the obvious material battles but those that were fought and won behind your forehead, how your wilful resolution to wrest the secret from life gave me heart and how in your absolute indifference to public canons of art, friends and shibboleths you walked in the light of your inward heroism. And this is what I write to you of now. Your work on earth draws to a close and you are near the silence. It is growing dark for you. Many write of such things, but they do not know. You have only opened the way — though you have gone as far as you could upon it — to the end of &#39;John Gabriel Borkman&#39; and its spiritual truth — but your last play stands, I take it, apart. But I am sure that higher and holier enlightenment lies — onward.

As one of the young generation for whom you have spoken I give you greeting — not humbly, because I am obscure and you in the glare, not sadly, because you are an old man and I am a young man, not presumptuously nor sentimentally — but joyfully, with hope and with love, I give you greeting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>VQR is the Smartest Magazine on the Planet and Has Embraced the Future of Magazines</title>

   <id>/article/2010/06/10/vqr-is-the-smartest-magazine-on-the-planet-and-has-embraced-the-future-of-magazines</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-10-at-10.06.17-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-256&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-10-at-10.06.17-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;158&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I only started reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vqronline.org/&quot;&gt;The Virginia Quarterly Review&lt;/a&gt; (VQR) after they won the National Magazine Award in 2006. It’s a big fat journal, beautifully produced and smartly edited. The magazine is squarely aimed at a general audience with a wide variety of interests, including world affairs and the arts. For instance, the Spring issue this year is subtitled “Graveyard of Empires: Obama’s Afghanistan” with journalist’s accounts from the field, but also poetry by Tadeusz Rózewicz (including a terrific introduction by Ed Hirsch: “…a poet of dark refusals, hard negations”). There are also essays by Edward Falco, “An Elliptical Essay on Violence” and Michael David Lukas, “Workshopping the Next Generation of American War Literature.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what makes VQR &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; smart these days is that they have seen the future of magazines, and that future is “EPUB.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epub&quot;&gt;EPUB&lt;/a&gt; is the current standard for ebooks, or more precisely, the “format for reflowable digital books and publications.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current attempts by magazines to port their print editions into a glossy format for tablet computers (let’s move on and recognize that iPad is merely the first of these) is lame and misguided. Let’s face it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zinio.com/&quot;&gt;Zinio&lt;/a&gt;, the primary app for presenting digital versions of print magazines, is anemic, and won’t exist in its current form for very long. Individual apps, like Wired, with some level of interactivity and whiz bang, may work when they get that interactivity and whiz bang down, but production costs will likely favor only certain types of magazines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, at the moment the EPUB standard leaves a bit to be desired, but if you’ve never seen a hard copy of VQR, which is beautiful, you wouldn’t feel like you were missing much. And the EPUB standard is improving. It will soon bridge the gap between print and digital in the most important senses and some of the sentient qualities lost from print will be offset by the many capabilities that digital brings to the table. It’s clear that the VQR team has invested a lot of effort on design and this issue is better produced than a lot of books I’ve seen (publishers take note, please).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In announcing their decision to publish on the iPad specifically, VQR said on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vqronline.org/blog/2010/06/08/vqr-ipad/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It may seem a bit narrow to produce a version of the publication solely for the iPad—rather than supporting the Kindle, Nook, or Sony Reader—but it was a decision that we came to after a lot of study and consideration. It is important to us that we distribute VQR in a manner that is open, unencumbered by the limitations of digital rights management and patents. And it is important to us that the photographs in our pages be reproduced without a significant loss in quality. This leaves only e-readers that support &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB&quot;&gt;the ePub standard&lt;/a&gt;, which rules out the Kindle. The Nook and the Reader have only crude black-and-white displays, leaving the iPad as the only candidate that meets our criteria. Apple is slated to release their eBooks software for the iPhone and iPod Touch, which will make our digital edition of the magazine available on any of the one hundred million portable Apple devices in use today. We hope to support more devices in the future as they embrace the ePub standard and full-color images.

...&quot;[We&#39;ve] been around for 85 years. We take the long view. The open, simple, accessible, indexable, archivable ePub format is clearly the best option for us and for our readers.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_271” align=”alignleft” width=”150” caption=”Some of my litmag collection (click for larger)”]&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/litmags.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-thumbnail wp-image-271&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/litmags-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a reader, this is fantastic news. I’ve been a magazine addict my entire adult life, often subscribing to thirty or more publications at a time. However, keeping them creates piles and piles of paper, virtually ensuring that a good portion of them will go unread. Living digital just means one more file that I can search and store and return to as often as I like. In the future, when printing costs aren’t a factor, particularly for low-print run magazines and journals , they will be priced more affordably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lit journals in particular should embrace EPUB immediately. I love you all, but paying $12 for every issue of every journal packed to the gills with writers most people have never heard of has value only to the culture at large, but rarely to actual readers (as my friend Richard Nash points out “your slush-pile are your readers”). There is no greater planned obsolescence than a lit journal, yet there has never been a more opportune time to bring literature and ideas into the greater cultural conversation. Web sites are great, but leave out the immersive qualities that ebooks promise for reading things that require sustained attention. VQR’s Spring edition is priced at $3.99, which seems more than fair to me given its 305 pages of content and its print subscription (for four issues) of $32 per year. If you are one of the millions with an iPad—a new one gets sold every three seconds, they say— buy a copy of VQR. You won’t be sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;addendum: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/Weegee&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kevin Smokler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; points out on Twitter that the (excellent and forward thinking) journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electricliterature.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electric Literature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; has already published in EPUB, a fact I should have known because I mentioned them some time ago when they published an iPhone app. The 2nd issue has Lydia Davis and Colson Whitehead, among others, the current issue includes Aimee Bender. Buy that too! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;p.s. point to explore: How will subscription models work in EPUB?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Good Design Can Lead us to Freedom: On iPad Apps vs the Web, and Free</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/06/01/how-good-design-can-lead-us-to-freedom-on-ipad-apps-vs-the-web-and-free/"/>
   <updated>2010-06-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/06/01/how-good-design-can-lead-us-to-freedom-on-ipad-apps-vs-the-web-and-free</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot of smart &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/ipad-revolution/&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; are commenting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/05/why-the-biggest-competitor-to-ipad-news-apps-may-be-a-familiar-face/&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; newspaper and magazine iPad apps as though the apps’ features are set in stone. There’s no reason for there not to be links within an app, for instance, and there’s no reason to think that the developers are ignorant of that fact. Yet, I’ve seen complaints about the lack of links and other fairly trivial aspects of iPad apps from several, usually more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/i-prefer-safari-to-content-apps-on-the-ipad.html&quot;&gt;perspicacious&lt;/a&gt;, sources. While conceding that some publisher’s misguided belief they’ve “rethought” the magazine are so far off the mark, we should be looking at apps in context of readers, journalism, and the Web. Considering that apps are in their early stages of development vis-á-vis the browser’s relatively long history, news apps have got a leap ahead of Web sites in reader-experience terms alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; are two instances of serious content apps that are not necessarily feature-rich now but have a business imperative to evolve, and the USA Today and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.subtraction.com/2010/06/01/ews-must-see-must-list&quot;&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt; apps are leading the way in design. They show great promise on the road to the newspaper becoming &lt;em&gt;merely&lt;/em&gt; “the news.” I find myself gravitating to the comparably simpler &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; apps on my iPad, despite their lack of features, instead of the Web and certainly opposed to consuming content on my laptop, and I think in time others will too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apps’ point of value will arrive when they bring the most powerful features of the Web — personalized browsing, sharing, linking —  with a reading experience that the Web clearly lacks. It’s easy to see, looking at the screenshots below, how the app clearly gives us a better reading experience (though, as I’ve mentioned before, app design will spill over into better Web design too):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0009.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-165&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 15px&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0009-225x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0010.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-166&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 15px&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0010-225x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are screenshots of the same article taken at the same time. The one on the left is from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; on the Web via iPad’s Safari. The other is via &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; iPad app (n.b. the video embedded in the lower right.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no contest. The app is a better user experience, despite the — arguable — fact that &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Web site is one of the better designed news sites out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the app you can effortlessly turn the page (less effortlessly than turning the actual paper and without the time drag and disorientation of loading the next page of a Website), share the article (for the moment limited to email), watch a video, and return to the home screen. That’s it. The isolation and lack of options is a benefit to readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an easy to distinguish difference in the amount of noise on the page (this is why readers in the know gravitate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapaper.com/&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/&quot;&gt;Readability&lt;/a&gt; - both lacking many of the “features” you’d find on Web sites).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webstyleguide.com/&quot;&gt;The Web Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; points out a fundamental shortcoming of the Web (and one we designers are faced to deal with daily):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Text on the computer screen is hard to read not only because of the low resolution of computer screens but also because the layout of most Web pages violates a fundamental rule of book and magazine typography: the lines of text on most Web pages are far too long for easy reading. Magazine and book columns are narrow for physiological reasons: at normal reading distances the eye&#39;s span of acute focus is only about three inches wide, so designers try to keep dense passages of text in columns not much wider than that comfortable eye span. Wider lines of text require readers to move their heads slightly or strain their eye muscles to track over the long lines of text. Readability suffers because on the long trip back to the left margin the reader may lose track of the next line.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;em&gt;Times’&lt;/em&gt; app’s columns are meant to mimic print newspapers (a concept the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; app took way too far) rather than strike a balance of line length for good readability, the column widths here work well in the fixed space of the iPad’s screen and are far more readable than what we are presented with on Web sites. &lt;em&gt;The Times’ International Herald Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, before it was folded into their global offerings, displayed articles in columnar format, so it is possible (though, I’ve tried and it’s difficult to pull off in a dynamic setting) to do that on the Web, but instead we are left with virtually a Web-wide one-size-fits-all text dump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;USA Today’s&lt;/em&gt; app has a very clean interface and is easy to use and read. Despite a few issues begging for standard practices for app design, even in these early stages, the app is superior to both the Web site and to print:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/USA-Today-iPad-app-front-page.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-225&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 15px;clear: both&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/USA-Today-iPad-app-front-page-225x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/USA-Today-iPad-app-article.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-226&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 15px&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/USA-Today-iPad-app-article-225x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think — and the big publishers are betting — that people will pay for that enhanced experience when it’s backed with good journalism. Jacob Weisberg calls it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2253821&quot;&gt;“pretty;”&lt;/a&gt; I call it good design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three-quarters of a million people who still subscribe to &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;, which is not cheap, despite the free version on the Web. &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;, a profitable political news Web site, still maintains its print base. While there are lots of factors driving the legacy of print subscriptions, as tablets and readers improve and proliferate and the overall quality improves, print magazines and newspapers will have little reason to exist in their print form beyond sentimental reasons and we all know sentiment doesn’t pay the bills. While business models will certainly evolve, it’s erroneous to think that the business of journalism will merely cease to exist (that is, no one will pay for it) because there are free alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m as uncomfortable as anyone with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden_(technology)&quot;&gt;“walled garden”&lt;/a&gt; being imposed upon the Web in the name of consumerism. The iPad is a harbinger of the end of geekdom, or a new kind of geek. Lets face it, the Open Source era of the Web is not as free and open as it used to be. Everything is monetized; “free” is just another word for indirect monetization or the price of gaining marketshare. But free shouldn’t be a feature, particularly if the implicit costs are high. Think how earlier generations were duped into thinking that beef should be close to free. Now we’re finding that the cost of all that cheap beef is that it’s killing us, not to mention the destruction of our natural resources and the treatment of animals in factory farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tech venture capitalist (whose name Newsweek seems to have lost) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/2010/02/25/the-future-won-t-be-free.html&quot;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; the irony of paying for print as though we are all aware that the physical object is somehow worth more than the information it contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I buy the dead-tree version of my local newspaper, I have no expectation that it should be free. If I pick it up and walk out of the coffee shop without paying, that&#39;s stealing. But when I walk upstairs to my office and log on to the Web site for the same paper, I feel a divine right to access the entirety of that paper—and 10 years of its archives—for free.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we have allowed our listening experience to be cheapened by the convenience of mp3s, we’ve allowed our reading experience to be cheapened by the freedom of the Web (this spoken, mind you, from a Web designer and avid blogger approaching his eighth year). Among other things (and granted, this isn’t just a Web problem), the prospect of the “news” being driven more by political-backed bias machines rather than objective journalism leaves me with an uneasy feeling. There is a democratic imperative to pay for serious journalism, where, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/sep/24/the-times-amp-the-internet/&quot;&gt;Bill Keller&lt;/a&gt; says (in reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/michael-massing/&quot;&gt;Michael Massing’s&lt;/a&gt; interesting pieces in &lt;em&gt;The New York Review of Books&lt;/em&gt; on news and the internet) to “go places, bear witness, develop sources, dig, and explain, and trust readers to draw their own conclusions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may sound trivial to say that design — much less the design of iPad apps — can lead us out of the mess that the field of journalism finds itself in, it is a critical first step on the road to a new media business model. Richard Lanham writes in his seminal book, &lt;em&gt;The Economics of Attention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The most obvious new group of attention economists may be the computer-human interface designers. This branch of information design subsumes all the efforts at Web site design, amateur and professional, which we encounter on our daily voyage through cyberspace. The Internet constitutes the pure case of an attention economy. &quot;Eyeballs&quot; constitute the coin of the realm....the economics that matters in this new theater, is design.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>#FridayReads - Incantation by Laughter and The Thing Around Your Neck</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/05/21/fridayreads-incantation-by-laughter-and-the-thing-around-your-neck/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/05/21/fridayreads-incantation-by-laughter-and-the-thing-around-your-neck</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had a little party the other night to celebrate the release of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordswithoutborders.org/books/#the-ecco-anthology-of-international-poetry&quot;&gt;The Ecco Anthology of International Poetry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Twenty or so people gathered in a beautiful Manhattan apartment with the treat of having the renowned poet, and president of the Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, Edward Hirsch read to us from the anthology. It’s a massive collection so to pick a couple of poems to represent the whole is difficult, but Hirsch picked one that I think actually represents the challenges of poetry and translation. The poem is Velimir Khlebnikov’s “Incantation by Laughter” in which Khlebnikov riffs, in Russian, on the various ways to express laughter in his language. Paul Schmidt did a fantastic job of creating something that I have to imagine recreates the original while creating something wholly new. Here are the first five lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hlahla! Uthlofan, lauflings!

Hlahla! Uflofan, lauflings!

Who lawghen with lafe, who hlaegen lewchly,

Hlahla! Uflofan hlouly!

Hlahla! Hloufish lauflings lafe uf beloght lauchalorum!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might like to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://bigthink.com/edwardhirsch&quot;&gt;Edward Hirsch’s Big Think video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been reading Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s stories collected in &lt;em&gt;The Thing Around Your Neck.&lt;/em&gt; This book will be passed around from English and writing teachers to students for years to come. Her stories are flawless. Perhaps even a bit too good. Emotionally distant. Though that may be unfair to say just yet. Here’s a video of her TED talk: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story.html&quot;&gt;Chimamanda Adichie: The danger of a single story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;#FridayReads is a twitter phenomenon where people share what they’re reading. It’s a fun exercise, but 140 characters doesn’t seem enough…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Do Tools Matter? On Collaborative Writing</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/05/17/do-tools-matter-on-collaborative-writing/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/05/17/do-tools-matter-on-collaborative-writing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Matt Bell is a terrific writer and an exemplar of ‘born digital.’ If you follow writing circles online you will find Matt. That’s one reason  -two, actually - I’m watching his online writing exercise this week at “Everday Genius,” the online journal of the chapbook publisher Publishing Genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt’s week at “Everyday Genius” will begin with him starting a story on Monday, seeded from his “failure files” (his writing block isn’t so much as an ability to write, but an inability to write something he feels worthwhile to publish, he explains), then turning it over to two different authors over the course of the week, then over to the community at large, and then back to Matt on Friday to revise before they publish the final story on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like this exercise because it gives the author some level of control while mimicking not just collaborative writing, but the editorial process to a degree. At the very least it takes the writer out of his vacuum while leaving him in control of the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborative writing has been around for a long time. I have several books of not-bad attempts at it. Penguin UK (a leader among publishers in terms of their online work) recently attempted and failed a massive collaborative writing exercise, using a Wiki. Truthfully, it was too massive and showman-like to produce anything good, but perhaps served its purpose in the iterative sense of moving forward with possibilities. Ultimately though, too many cooks in the pot at the least, and I think that the exercise demonstrated that a wiki is not a place for “writing” so much as a place for “documenting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting about “Everyday Genius’s” project is that it puts a lone writer on the line. This is brave because creative writing at its best comes from deep places within, yet the form Matt is doing this in is something akin to an art installation where the artist lives in a glass booth baring all to the world around him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where the tools come in to play. Matt will be writing his story, along with his collaborators, on software called “EtherPad” (I’m not sure if they’ll be using their own installation of Etherpad, which went Opensource when Google bought the company who created it last year, but there’s an installation of it called “MeetingWords” available freely online).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-122&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-17-at-2.06.36-PM-e1274119647557.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;186&quot; /&gt; The beauty of Etherpad is that it truly is real-time and it’s very easy to see who is doing what to the text. I’ve used it before to edit articles at “Dispatches” at &lt;em&gt;Words Without Borders&lt;/em&gt; (as well its decidedly less real-time brethren, Writeboard). Writing on Etherpad is fun to watch, if a little eerie at first, as another person’s writing appears before your eyes. The software has a chat function where writers can talk about what they’re writing. Obviously there are implications here for all sorts of uses (n.b. Google Wave).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I think is really interesting - taking it back down to earth with “Everyday Genius’s” purpose - is how it affects one’s writing in a creative or critical sense. Is it possible that this can make for better writing? I know that from my perspective as an editor working with a writer it was incredibly productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’ve been a student of over the past seven years of building Websites is watching how people interact with technology: how technology influences what they write; for instance, the difference between articles, blog posts, micro-blog posts, as an enabler or hindrance to certain types of writing. It’s plain to see that a piece written outside of the Web entirely (e.g. on MS Word, ugh) may be entirely different than one written in the control panel of a content management system or a bookmarklet popup. That might be due to technological noise - the inhibiting feel of a text-editor - but I think there’s a time factor at play as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside of sorts, I often have to communicate to my Web design clients my design conceptions for their site. In the past I typically created a static mockup of the site and sent it to the client via email. Sometimes my design ideas don’t jive with the client’s expectations or there’s some element that I want the client to react to without me prompting them with expectations. This rarely works out well or smoothly, but I found that the more time that went by between when I sent the mockup to our discussion of it, the issues were always amplified to the same degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve begun to only reveal the design with the client when I have them on the phone, reviewing the designs then and there and making small changes as part of our conversation and instantly putting those changes up for them to see. What before seemed monumental tends to evaporate into just part of the discussion, even if the result is a bit less polished than it might have been the old way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing sometimes loses its way. That’s why we have editors. But as any writer knows, it hurts quite a bit to see your words changed for you. I think shortening the distance between writer and editor, or writer and collaborator may stand to improve writing in general and the possibility of a form of writing that never has been able to get out of the gate. “Everyday Genius’s” exercise, along with sites like BookOven may go along way to getting us there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Web Media Can Learn from Print</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/05/13/what-web-media-can-learn-from-print/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/05/13/what-web-media-can-learn-from-print</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the death throes of Newsweek there are a lot of Web publishers wallowing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asylum.com/2010/05/07/an-open-letter-to-magazines-from-the-internet/&quot;&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/a&gt; as the scales are tipping in their direction. What Newsweek has shown is that there’s more to being successful on the Web than being there and even a shift from a weekly print mag to a daily news mag with a “best of” print edition will likely fail too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, at the same time I see Web media publishers scoff at print media attempts to monetize with pay-walls and dedicated apps, and even readers are up in arms at the prospect of paying for something they’ve gotten used to getting for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the comments I’ve seen about, for instance, the New York Times’ iPad app, assume that this is a static phenomenon when the fact is that these apps can and will improve quickly and soon will be feature rich and create an incomparable user experience that readers will pay for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web is great, but needs to improve as print readers complete the shift to online. I suspect that there will be a convergence of usability between dedicated apps and Websites, but just as print was slow to get the picture about the web, the web is slow to create a good reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you hear someone say they like “holding” a paper in their hands what they really mean is that reading online sucks. It doesn’t have to be that way. The most popular news sites on the Web look horrible and do little to promote actual reading. It amazes me that when pundits talk about the fact that people skim instead of read online that they assume that that can’t change; that it’s a function of being online, when the fact is that the more closed in experience of reading an app or using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapaper.com/&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/&quot;&gt;Readability&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate that there can be a better experience - and that’s not even taking into account the difference between reading these articles on a consumption oriented device, such as an iPad and other innovations we’ve yet to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What apps and pay walls do for publishers is segment an audience who want a dedicated, high quality reading experience. Readers who pay three or four hundred dollars a year to subscribe to the print edition of the New York Times are probably not subscribing to a lot of other papers, despite the fact that there have always been hundreds to choose from. We’ve grown accustomed to thinking about content but don’t underestimate the value of convenience and experience. Even if the subscription base has eroded for these companies, there are still millions of dollars of subscriptions out there that need to go somewhere. I’m not saying that revenue/pay issues will be easy to solve or work themselves out in a year, but I do believe that as print disappears the economics will change, the dollars will shift and it’s not safe to say content wants to be free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the Web. As long as Web publishers don’t address the lower quality experience readers get today, their readers will not be loyal (yes, there will be exceptions, particularly the more blog-like publications).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-16-at-11.26.43-PM-e1274067139358.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-75&quot; style=&quot;border: 4px solid #CCC&quot; src=&quot;http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-16-at-11.26.43-PM-e1274067139358.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;293&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change needs to come from Editorial and Design. Design can learn from the greater experience, though still in its infancy, of iPad apps and think beyond what’s here and now. For example there are a handful of designers who are publicly musing how to design articles on the Web on a per-article basis, fitting the design to the subject of the article. It’s shouldn’t be inconceivable that we turn those ideas into a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editorial can learn by treating copy as though it will be on the shelf forever, which it will, and differentiating between blog posts and articles. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://cjr.org&quot;&gt;CJR&lt;/a&gt; study showed that magazine publishers do less copy editing on the web and I suspect that there is a technological gap to blame as well as a lack of importance assigned to Web copy. We’ve yet to develop processes for online publishing that work because editorial is forced to be far more technical than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As print disappears the window of opportunity for born digital publishers will narrow. They’ve been able to find their audience to date - and to be sure, there will always be some segment that will read these creations - but the death of Newsweek isn’t a time for celebration, it’s a time to realize that the shift from print to Web is really happening and competition for eyeballs will become even more intense and we need to think hard about not merely replicating the print experience online, but improving it so that there is nothing lost when the shift ultimately happens.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Blogs, Twitter, the Kindle: The Future of Reading at The PEN World Voices Festival</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/05/11/blogs-twitter-the-kindle-the-future-of-reading-at-the-pen-world-voices-festival/"/>

   <id>/article/2010/05/11/blogs-twitter-the-kindle-the-future-of-reading-at-the-pen-world-voices-festival</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-pvtn9IXNo&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded&quot;&gt;PEN World Voices Festival&lt;/a&gt;“Blogs, Twitter, the Kindle: The Future of Reading” was the panel I went to at PEN World Voices Festival (video) that - If you happened to have followed my &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/budparr&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; stream during the event you know  - I was quite disappointed by the direction it took, primarily because I thought it was a lost opportunity for some really terrific, serious writers to discuss the fate of literary culture in the digital age, as the program promised. From the PEN World Voices Festival &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pen.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/4728/prmID/1986&quot;&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; to the panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Philip Roth recently said that reading novels would be a “cultic” activity in 25 years, adding that “the book can’t compete with the screen.” Do other writers share his pessimism? How does the situation differ across cultures and continents—and are there lessons in those differences?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the discussion dwelled on trivialities like the “Toy Story” (a movie, if for some strange reason you don’t know it) app on the iPad, which in my view has little do with the type of literature everyone on the panel writes and entirely mocks the issue. I highly doubt Roth was being so obvious when he said that. Or… maybe I’m just grumpy, other commenters on the panel weren’t so disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some highlights when panelists talked about their blogging and twitter activity, but even those comments were pretty much dead-on-arrival, and one of the panelists chose not to add anything at all, but instead let us know how sharp his sense of irony is. Definitely the low point of an otherwise terrific festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see some serious discussion of the matter, head upstate next month for the Rochester Institute of Technology’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://futureofreading.cias.rit.edu/2010/index.php&quot;&gt;“Future of Reading”&lt;/a&gt; conference, which I hope &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=2680&quot;&gt;Chad Post&lt;/a&gt; will be covering in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p.s. My question comes in the 58:30 mark. I asked two questions. The first was whether or not anyone on the panel had read an entire book on an iPad/Kindle/Nook/Sony Reader in the past year. Only one of the panelists said yes, he had.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My sentiments exactly: Max Magee on Book Reviews</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;posterous_bookmarklet_entry&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;This is the sort of thing the Web does well. Max is a great editor who created his own site and quietly shakes things up by not just going along with the traditional idea of the book review. Instead of sitting back and complaining about the New York Times Book Review, he puts his ideas into practice:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;posterous_long_quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;To be honest, I&#39;m not a big fan of book reviews, generally. We have some writers who are exceptional at writing book reviews, and I would happily read their thoughts on every book they pick up. However, I think the traditional newspaper book review can be rather boring.&lt;/div&gt;
When a review comes across my desk, I often haven&#39;t read the book in question (I can only read so much) and I may not be particularly interested in reading the book, but if I am still nonetheless interested in reading the review on its own terms, then the review is a success. Many, many book reviews, from those in newspapers to those on the lowliest website, do not pass this test.

I don&#39;t mean to say that we don&#39;t publish the occasional straight-ahead review––we do––but whenever possible, I like to bring something stylistically fresh to the table so that every reader who comes across the review has the potential to be engaged by it, whether or not they were interested in the book at hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>When Google Dominates the Way We (Find, Buy) Read E-books</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/05/04/when-google-dominates-the-way-we-find-buy-read-e-books/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/05/04/when-google-dominates-the-way-we-find-buy-read-e-books</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning Google announced - re-announced - that they will launch their foray into e-book selling as soon as this summer. Chris Palma, Google’s head of Strategic Partner Development, spoke this morning at the offices of Random House as part of panel discussion hosted by Publishers Weekly on the future of book publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an idea Google has let percolate for quite a while, Palma said, but only now with the proliferation of devices and major players do they feel it is finally the right time to throw their hat into the e-book ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Editions will build upon Google&#39;s existing Book Search product: &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/&quot;&gt;http://books.google.com/&lt;/a&gt; Search and access books just the way you do now, only soon you&#39;ll be able to buy your books directly from Google (or via an Online retailer - Powell&#39;s was the example used) and add them to your google (Gmail) account for reading on any device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#39;s mantra is buy anywhere, read anywhere. That also is what most of the e-book players say, but Google means it. They see their audience not as the millions of people who have bought Kindles or iPads, but the entire universe of 1.8 billion internet users and Google&#39;s reader will simply be a Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their books will exist solely in &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing&quot;&gt;the cloud&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; which may have some interesting implications: namely, there&#39;s no file to download. When you read a Google e-book, you are reading a cached file online (yes, you will have offline access thanks to the newest version of HTML 5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if there&#39;s no file to download, there&#39;s no file to share or steal. Palma made the point that if a user wanted to share a Google e-book they&#39;d have to share their entire Google account, which could include Gmail, your Web history, and so forth, with the reasoning that few are likely to do this. This may or may not be foolproof though Palma indicated that even if a hacker got into an account they&#39;d be accessing one book only without the ability to do any pirating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup also may also be an answer to Digital Rights Management issues. I wonder - the question wasn&#39;t broached - if their method would lead to the possibility of a user relinquishing their right to a book and turning that right over to someone else, for a limited time or permanently. This seems possible because there&#39;s no file to replicate, but remains to be seen or even discussed, to my knowledge. I do think the ability to share will sooner or later be a matter of consumer demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Palma touted the ability for readers to search across their entire library or to share their margin notes with friends or any buyer of the same book, one of the audience wondered how the search function will affect which books get exposure. The answer of course, as it always is with Google, is relevance, leaving a gaping question about which books get sold. Thinking about how Google search works, it would seem that the latest edition would get the most exposure at any given time, completely independent of each version&#39;s relative merits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of today&#39;s discussion was industry focused and centered around the three major players: Google, Amazon, and Apple. One panelist, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackplasticglasses.com&quot;&gt;Evan Schnittman&lt;/a&gt; from Oxford University Press, went into the relative strengths and weaknesses of each and the various models they operated under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#39;s approach of using an HTML, browser-based reader (books will be in e-pub format) may leave a lot desired for a lot of readers as it&#39;s been my experience so far that apps are nicer, generally speaking. Google&#39;s focus is on the less exciting aspects of e-books - search and annotation, rather than the reading experience - which might limit their impact to certain types of books, though just how the reader will perform remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me from listening to this panel that this is Amazon&#39;s game to lose, and with over a million iPads out in the wild in the first month alone, both Google and Apple, despite their differences, about which Palma made some vague references, will drive the e-book market in the future. Well, we&#39;ll see, but that was how I came away feeling from today&#39;s talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire discussion was taped by C-Span, so may be available on their Website soon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It's the End of Free As We Thought We Knew It</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/04/16/it-s-the-end-of-free-as-we-thought-we-knew-it/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/04/16/it-s-the-end-of-free-as-we-thought-we-knew-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I worked on Wall Street the common wisdom was “fade the press” meaning that when Time and Newsweek, etc all led with stories of doom for the economy then it was time buy. This was an old and well worn principle, yet not one to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could it be that within ten months of when “Wired Magazine’s” Chris Anderson published his book &lt;em&gt;Free: The Future of a Radical Price&lt;/em&gt; that the pendulum is swinging? There’s much debate over whether or not old media establishments will survive charging for content (the iPad will not save them, the mantra goes) because “content wants to be free.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people outside of media, including Marc Andreessen, the founder of Netscape - which was a great thing to create but is notably no longer in existence - say old media is &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/06/andreessen-media-burn-boats/&quot;&gt;“shortsighted at best”&lt;/a&gt; trying to charge money for content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, Andreessen’s Ning network - another great thing whose story is not yet final - just announced that they are no longer free. And what’s more, they are, according to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/15/nings-bubble-bursts-no-more-free-networks-cuts-40-of-staff/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch article&lt;/a&gt;, kicking out all their previously existing free networks unless they start paying. That seems like a drastic and shortsighted move to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ever-brilliant &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/&quot;&gt;37 Signals&lt;/a&gt; gang doesn’t believe in “free” as a business concept, but they’ve always offered a free version of their applications (indeed, the ability to move back and forth between free and paid versions as conditions warrant is what has kept me as a customer all these years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blog Gigaom has a relatively new and terrific paid site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pro.gigaom.com/&quot;&gt;Gigaom Pro&lt;/a&gt;, for more advanced research, Twitter is desperately trying to monetize without charging directly (a plan which I seem to be the only one who will think fail)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And truth is, I love reading some newspapers in the iPad app version and would pay for it if it were really well designed so as to give me control over how I consume the paper. Yes, it’s true there’s tons of great content on the Web, but even the best designed Web-based papers have lots and lots of noise (ads and links everywhere) and do a pretty poor job of taking into account what I may have read already, what sections I tend to read, what stories I’m following, etc. (though solving these issues may or may not be a Web vs app question).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that while content in general tends toward free there is room for the right content presented well that is worth paying for; no one has found the right model yet, but corner people long enough and they’ll figure something out. “Old Media” is nothing if not cornered. Don’t discount the need to make sense of all the noise and what that might be worth; we just have to figure out where value lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe free’s just another word for nothing left to lose (now managing to get two song title cliches into a single post) or the price to entry for players who can’t demand a market price. Then price becomes, like Veblen goods, sort of (these are goods that, for psychological reasons, greater price infers greater status or perceived value), an actual mechanism of value. It’s early yet and bringing prices back depends on most all of the players to start charging, an interesting problem for game theorists.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Jazz Lexicon - 'A unique and rebellious way of speaking...'</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/03/22/a-jazz-lexicon-a-unique-and-rebellious-way-of-speaking/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/03/22/a-jazz-lexicon-a-unique-and-rebellious-way-of-speaking</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another find while packing (see my previous post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://budparr.posterous.com/take-the-scenic-route-to-knowledge-on-brewers&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is Bob Gold’s &lt;em&gt;A Jazz Lexicon&lt;/em&gt; from 1964. My copy is signed “To the Richardson All-Stars - Richie, Johnnie, Jon &amp;amp; Brooke - with love, Bob Gold 7/23/64” A quick look on the internet and some of my other jazz books gave me no clue to who those guys were but the inscription gives it a nice sense of authenticity and begs the history of the book; how it might have found it’s way from someone in the Richardson All-Stars to a used bookstore in Brookyn, where I bought it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This dictionary is for 20th Century slang from the jazz set. I found a letter to the editor of the New York Review of Books by the author on the use of the word &quot;hep:&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;Your recent correspondent, Cal Kolbe Nossiter, in attempting to correct Philip Rahv&#39;s nominal use of &quot;hip&quot; merely proliferates the error by identifying the term &quot;hip&quot; as a variant of &quot;hep.&quot; Anyone familiar with the jazz scene (or anyone familiar with my recent dictionary of jazz slang, A Jazz Lexicon) knows that the word has always been &quot;hip,&quot; and that &quot;hep&quot; is hopelessly square.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For instance, &quot;pork chop&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;[prob. from jazzman&#39;s approval of both; according to jazzmen, current c. 1900-c 1917, obs. since; see also BARRELHOUSE, GULLY-LOW, LOWDOWN] Slow, earthy blues music. Oral evidence only.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To &quot;collar the jive&quot; was a phrase used by Cab Calloway and part of general slang earlier in the century to mean &quot;to understand and fee rapport with what is being said; to be in the know; to be hip. c1935 jive term.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Like the &lt;em&gt;Brewer&#39;s Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;, it&#39;s tempting to write these words off as quaint, particularly much of the drug-culture related slang, but here especially they represent a history, one with sociological resonance, as Gold points out in his introduction: &quot;...So we get a people in rebellion against a dominant majority, but forced to rebel secretly, to sublimate, as the psychologist would put it--to express themselves culturally through the medium of jazz, and linguistically through a code, a jargon...&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;And because much of the language from the early jazz era was spoken, its presence here is all the more remarkable. As much as I love my lovely found hardback copy, if there were ever a case for the digitization of books, having this now out-of-print history of a special set of words is an acute one.&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>'Take the scenic route to knowledge' - On Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase & Fable</title>
   <link href="/article/2010/03/19/take-the-scenic-route-to-knowledge-on-brewer-s-dictionary-of-phrase-fable/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2010/03/19/take-the-scenic-route-to-knowledge-on-brewer-s-dictionary-of-phrase-fable</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Packing my books away for our move, I keep running into great things I’ve not looked at in a while. One of them is &lt;em&gt;Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase &amp;amp; Fable&lt;/em&gt;. I love dictionaries and reference books in the first place–have quite a few–but this one is truly unique. My edition is from 1970, the “Centenary Edition” as it was first published in 1870. To its credit, it’s never been out of print, but truth is, even though there’s a newer edition out this year even, it doesn’t matter to me because the old dictionaries show words to be something of an artifact and etymologies don’t really capture how meaning evolves (or devolves!, as the case may be).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The definition for &quot;screw&quot; goes like this:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Slang for wages, salary; possibly because in some employments it was handed out in &#39;screwed up on paper&#39; or because it was &#39;screwed out&#39; of one&#39;s employer; it is also slang for a prison warder, from the days when the locks were operated from a screw-like movement.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Modern definitions, while much more thorough, are, needless to say, nothing like this one. Likewise, &quot;Screwed&quot; is defined here as &quot;intoxicated. A playful synonym of &lt;em&gt;tight&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; Of course in a modern context these definitions seem merely quaint, but there are tons of things here that just don&#39;t exist now either.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You&#39;ll find entries, for example, with stories like that of &quot;John o&#39; Groats&quot;:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&quot;The site of a legendary house 1 3/4 miles west of Duncansby Head Caithness, Scotland. The story is of...three Dutch brothers, came to this part of Scotland in the reign of James IV. There came to be eight families of the name and they met annually to celebrate. On once occasion a question of precedency arose, consequently John o&#39;Groat built an eight-sided room with a door to each side and placed an octagonal table therein so that all were &#39;head of the table&#39;. This building went ever after with the name of John o&#39; Groat&#39;s House.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At any rate, Dr Ebenezer Cobham Brewer was, as far as I can tell from his biography in the &quot;Centenary Edition,&quot; a man who did little besides read, write and garden. The list of books he wrote or edited is astounding, beginning in 1841 (Brewer was born in 1810) with &lt;em&gt;A Guide to Science&lt;/em&gt;, which went into 47 editions and sold more than 319,000 copies by 1905. He wrote books on accounting, scripture, Greek, Roman, French history, as well as a &lt;em&gt;Political, Social, and Literary History of Germany&lt;/em&gt;, and near the end of his life, &lt;em&gt;A Dictionary of Miracles&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <id>/article/2010/03/04/history-is-the-blood</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/budparr/v4ljgkg06AKnd4YQFP4RjXXAtefuIM6dxEOXiFsMapYmPPBAJvEpvKPOxhMJ/spcivilwar.jpg.thumb100.jpg?content_part=6tJaY3nVJ3suoFAAIPRw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;This quote rings true… “History is the blood running through the river while life goes on on the banks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading – at the rate of about 10 pages per day – Hugh Thomas’s &lt;em&gt;The Spanish Civil War&lt;/em&gt;, a book I’ve had since I began reading on the war either thematically or as a subject about five years ago. I hadn’t ventured into it because it’s thick and dense; about 950 pages of history, it’s not my usual reading. But I realized when recently reading Bola&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Helvetica&quot;&gt;ño’s &lt;em&gt;Monsieur Pain&lt;/em&gt; that there were still huge gaps in my understanding of the Spanish Civil War (in that particular instance it was something about the Falangists that piqued my interest) . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only gotten into the period prior to the war so far, a large swath covering the last quarter of the 19th Century and early 20th, but one would gather that in this time there was nothing going on but violence and murder, riots, anarchy. I don’t doubt that it was like that  – look at parts of modern Mexico or Colombia for but two examples– but in light of the discussion going on around David Sheilds’ &lt;em&gt;Reality Hunger: A Manifesto&lt;/em&gt; (which I haven’t read, but have been following the discussions) about the move to “nonfiction” I’d say that the true story, the “truer than” true story that is well written and well imagined fiction, is what happens on the banks and that’s where we get understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d go as far as saying that reading history is incomplete without reading the fiction, if it exists, around a period or events. It’s well known that Tolstoy’s &lt;em&gt;War &amp;amp; Peace&lt;/em&gt; is itself a history and while that novel may be an exception for its reading as an historical text it supports the idea that the sensitivity of a novelist who brings facts to life might be more valuable than the historian for the purposes that history serves, that is, not repeating our mistakes or inferring a better way to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the facts, which we know evolve over time, at least many of them, are merely guideposts or backdrop in my view. If you’ve ever been in a catastrophe reported in the news you know that the experience for most is far from the reality reported in the press. I recently read a blog post from a woman in Chile during the earthquake. Her report was more mundane than the press reports, but more human in my view and probably good fodder for a story (please understand that I’m only talking about story telling here and not trying to be unsympathetic to those lives affected by the tragedy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m not naive enough to think that life in Spain was just like Trueba’s romantic conception in the movie “Belle Epoque,” it’s shocking how the political upheaval in the Spain of that period permeated this otherwise cute film (in particular the priest’s suicide on the couple’s wedding day). I suppose that may have been the director’s intent. History is served through art. The thesis behind Javier Mar&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Helvetica&quot;&gt;ías’s novel &lt;em&gt;Your Face Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; is that we don’t really know people we think we know. We can’t see what they will be like in the future, which is why the thread of the Spanish Civil War is so important to that book. A civil war is a war of betrayal and no where does that become more apparent or real than in a story, which in this case is a fictionalized remembrance of actual events. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, my Spanish Civil War reading list is a mix of fiction and nonfiction. These are books that I’ve read, am reading, or intend to read, but far from comprehensive and not necessarily meant to be as it’s just one of those things that has taken up its own life in my reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the list. While I’m probably not interested in adding any more history books to this list because I think Thomas’s is particularly comprehensive, I’d love to hear any other reading suggestions you might have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh Thomas: &lt;em&gt;The Spanish Civil War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javier Cercas: &lt;em&gt;The Soldiers of Salamis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roberto &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;font-size: small&quot;&gt;Bolaño: &lt;em&gt;Monsieur Pain&lt;/em&gt; (this is on tangentially about the SCW)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javier &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;font-size: small&quot;&gt;Mar&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 12px&quot;&gt;ías: &lt;em&gt;Your Face Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;, Vols 1, 2 and 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camilo Jose Cela: &lt;em&gt;San Camilo, 1936&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernardo Atxaga: &lt;em&gt;The Accordianist’s Son&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Gibson: &lt;em&gt;The Death of Lorca&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Orwell: &lt;em&gt;Homage to Catalonia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ernest Hemingway: &lt;em&gt;For Whom the Bell Tolls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ernest Hemingway: &lt;em&gt;The Fifth Column…&lt;/em&gt; (not sure about this one because I can’t find it now)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Koch: &lt;em&gt;The Breaking Point - Hemingway, Dos Passos, and the Murder of Jose Robles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russell Martin: &lt;em&gt;Picasso’s War: The Extraordinary Story of an Artist, an Atrocity and a Painting That Shook the World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various poetry from the period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen mention of Raymond Carr’s &lt;em&gt;The Spanish Tragedy&lt;/em&gt; and I’d be interested to know if you’ve read it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Do You Do When You Sit and Listen?</title>
   <link href="/article/2009/12/04/what-do-you-do-when-you-sit-and-listen/"/>
   <updated>2009-12-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2009/12/04/what-do-you-do-when-you-sit-and-listen</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What do you do when you sit and listen to music or to someone read? The mind has a difficult time taking in images and sound at the same time, so the one or the other becomes a distraction. The reader’s facial expression, or with music, perhaps you marvel at the player’s technical skill instead of wholly taking it in. Even reading a book there’s a minuscule element, no matter how lost we may get in the narrative, that we are holding an object and reading words on a page and our back may be sore or our nails need clipping. Even more difficult with poetry because we can’t waste any words getting into the groove of things. This is why I always read poetry aloud. But even then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to a different topic and think for a second if you’ve ever seen the media of literature and video combined smartly, so that one does not become merely a distraction for the other. I can think of only rare instances when this works. Videos of readings, which are just a ‘couldn’t be there’ or saved for posterity thing, but not really of interest on their own. Then there’s some neat animations to accompany poetry I’ve seen. But then the animations take over the poetry, and that’s not good. The poetry is cheapened that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I read Christina Mengert’s review at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.constantcritic.com/christina_mengert/the-last-4-things/&quot;&gt;The Constant Critic&lt;/a&gt; of Kate Greenstreet’s &lt;em&gt;The Last 4 Things&lt;/em&gt;. Mengert begins with an interesting observation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A few years ago, I had the pleasure of hearing Kate Greenstreet read from her first book,&lt;em&gt;Case Sensitive&lt;/em&gt; (Ahsahta 2006). It struck me, at the time, how much her reading style conveyed the sense of thought in real time, as opposed to language that has been permanently crystallized and is now being rehearsed. The poems, in her mouth, carried a certain elusive feeling of spontaneity. I wondered if the poems on the page felt quite so alive, and was forced to admit, upon reading them, that while they did feel alive in a way, it seemed an inescapable quandary that once locked into the page, a poem felt, well, fixed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the rest of her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.constantcritic.com/christina_mengert/the-last-4-things/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, please, for a more in-depth look on how well the poetry works.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:15px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/bpy_thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re like me, you&amp;#8217;ve become addicted to your iPhone in the oddest ways, even though the phone service itself is horrible. I use it as a flashlight when I walk my son to the bathroom at night, and everyone knows it&amp;#8217;s a great distraction for your kids (&lt;a href=&quot;http://iphoneappdemos.tv/2009/02/bebot-robot-synth/&quot;&gt;Bebot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brushesapp.com/&quot;&gt;Brushes&lt;/a&gt;). That is if you can get it away from them or if they don&amp;#8217;t make odd phone calls or emails to your clients (if you&amp;#8217;ve ever gotten an email from me with nothing but &amp;#8220;yrixoxyt&amp;#8221; in the body, it came from Seamus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/shorteroed.png&quot; width=&quot;103&quot; height=&quot;111&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:8px&quot; /&gt; Among the myriad practical little apps, I became obsessed with &amp;#8220;The Weather Channel&amp;#8221; app over the summer, hoping each time that the little cloud icons would turn to sun (they never did). But what I truly love about my iPhone is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobisystems.com/product.html?p=13&amp;amp;l=1&amp;amp;pid=281&amp;amp;i=1&quot;&gt;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; app. For me, that alone is worth the price. Yes, it&amp;#8217;s expensive for an iPhone app, but we&amp;#8217;re talking about a massive dictionary, second only to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OED&lt;/span&gt; itself, always at your side (My other preferred dictionary, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2009-07/Webster.html&quot;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; Merriam-Webster Unabridged, I use online, if needed). The truly geeky can even use the &amp;#8220;random word&amp;#8221; button &amp;#8211; when faced with nothing else to do &amp;#8211; until you find something you don&amp;#8217;t know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/indiebound_thumb.png&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;148&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:8px&quot; /&gt; More than once I&amp;#8217;ve used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiebound.org/iphone&quot;&gt;IndieBound&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; iPhone app for looking up books when the conversation hinges upon remembering that author (and anyone who knows me knows I have a horrible memory). &amp;#8220;The something Hedgehog, wasn&amp;#8217;t it&amp;#8230;?&amp;#8221; yes, he says confidently, &amp;#8220;Elegance of the Hedgehog&amp;#8221; with the iPhone under the table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the reader wars are upon us, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lexcycle.com/&quot;&gt;Stanza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;docId=1000301301&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barnesandnoble.com/iphone/&quot;&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; e-readers, among others, competing &amp;#8211; on what, I don&amp;#8217;t know. I did manage to read Robert Louis Stevenson&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/em&gt; on my iPhone via Stanza when my five-year-old lost interest in the hardcopy we were reading. But I&amp;#8217;ve yet to be convinced that it&amp;#8217;s worth paying for any books there besides maybe something to read in an emergency &amp;#8211; you do know about reading emergencies, don&amp;#8217;t you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, despite the promise of e-readers, the so-called &amp;#8220;long-tail&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t yet exist. When the entire backlist of New Directions, Dalkey Archive and so on are available in the Kindle store, then maybe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/shakespeareplay.png&quot; width=&quot;259&quot; height=&quot;176&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:8px&quot; /&gt; Feel like brushing up on the play while waiting in line for your Shakespeare in the Park tickets? Read it on the free &lt;a href=&quot;http://playshakespeare.com/news/3668-shakespeare-on-iphone-update?q=iphone&quot;&gt;playshakespeare&lt;/a&gt; app, a companion to the PlayShakespeare.com Website. You&amp;#8217;re limited to only one version (First Folio of 1623 and the Globe Edition  of 1866), but it&amp;#8217;s quite a comprehensive app and will leave you sifting through sonnets for hours on end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the margins of usefulness, there&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://iphoneapps.oreilly.com/2009/07/next-read.html&quot;&gt;Next Read&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to keep lists of books and who recommended them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/electroniclit_thumb.png&quot; width=&quot;175&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:8px&quot; /&gt; So many apps, many more I&amp;#8217;m sure I don&amp;#8217;t know about, but I think one of the most interesting apps for the iPhone is one surely to help you out in a reading emergency: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electricliterature.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Electric Literature&lt;/a&gt; is a lit-mag with versions in paper, Kindle, e-readers and the iPhone (although, unfortunately, the iPhone version is only for one issue, not a subscription). Short stories by authors you may or may or may not know at your finger tips. When carrying around the latest issue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brickmag.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t an option, you&amp;#8217;ll find plenty to keep you busy with &amp;#8220;Electric Literature.&amp;#8221; The app doesn&amp;#8217;t have all the bells and whistles of other e-readers, but it does have the one thing that&amp;#8217;s paramount no matter what form&amp;#8230;the text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carolyn, at the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LAT&lt;/span&gt;imes &lt;a href=&quot;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2009/09/getting-bookishly-appy-with-the-iphone.html&quot;&gt;Jacket Copy blog&lt;/a&gt;, runs with the idea and adds some more depth to the &amp;#8220;Literary iPhone.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jonathan Baumbach Recommends “Spanking the Maid”</title>
   <link href="/article/2009/01/22/jonathan-baumbach-recommends-spanking-the-maid/"/>
   <updated>2009-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2009/01/22/jonathan-baumbach-recommends-spanking-the-maid</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me walk out on the stage by saying that surprise is a literary touchstone for me. That said, when one looks to be surprised by a work of fiction, it is all the more difficult to be caught out. To hope to be surprised, to look forward expectantly to being taken by surprise, is more than likely to cancel out the possibility. And what do I mean after all by surprise here? Everything original in the best sense is surprising in its way, which is to say that the great books continue to surprise even though our prior experience with them lets us think (gives us that jading illusion) that we know what&amp;#8217;s coming next. Once we are familiar with the twists of a surprising plot, unless we have conveniently faulty memories, we can never be surprised by them again. The books I&amp;#8217;ve admired, and continue to admire, have other ways of engendering surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A favorite quote of mine from the French filmmaker Robert Bresson exhorts the artist &amp;#8220;to bring together things that had not been brought together before and had not been predisposed to be so.&amp;#8221; That&amp;#8217;s the kind of surprise I believe I&amp;#8217;m talking about&amp;mdash;the surprise of flying in the face of the received rules. The writer among my contemporaries, whom I find the most surprising and therefore the most admirable, is Robert Coover, a household name only in the most enlightened households. Virtually all of Coover&amp;#8217;s fictions tend to have the quality of surprise that the Bresson quote refers to, which is at least one determinant of their&amp;#8217; pleasure for me. If I have to choose a single book of Coover&amp;#8217;s to recommend, and that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;m committed to doing, I would choose the seemingly modest novella, the playful, mock-pornographic, &amp;#8220;Spanking the Maid&amp;#8221;&amp;mdash;a book I&amp;#8217;ve presented to my classes at Brooklyn College over and over again&amp;#8212;because (and why not?) the choice is itself a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Your Face Tomorrow: Dance and Dream, by Javier Marias</title>
   <link href="/article/2008/11/07/your-face-tomorrow-dance-and-dream-by-javier-marias/"/>
   <updated>2008-11-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2008/11/07/your-face-tomorrow-dance-and-dream-by-javier-marias</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt; How to describe &lt;em&gt;Your Face Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;? Its title tells us nothing about what happens in the book and the subtitles of the individual volumes (it&amp;#8217;s a three volume novel, two of which have so far been translated into English and published by New Directions), &amp;#8220;Fever and Spear&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Dance and Dream&amp;#8221; are not quite motifs but something like mental markers, like, perhaps, the titles given to Abstract impressionist paintings. While there is action and even a story in &lt;em&gt;Your Face Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; I think it would be unfair to describe this novel that way. The story follows Jack Deza, an urbane Spaniard in England whose wife has left him, as he gets a job in the British Secret Service judging the truthfulness (loosely termed) of the unwitting diplomats, spies and other characters who pass through the agency&amp;#8217;s halls. While that story certainly has potential, I would mislead you if I told you that&amp;#8217;s what the book is about. Everything that happens in a Mar&amp;iacute;as novel is a colorful backdrop or even pretext for ruminating on the subject Jack or his creator are thinking about. And that&amp;#8217;s closer to the point than the story in and of itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javier Mar&amp;iacute;as&amp;#8217;s  extravagantly digressive writing ranges from sensuous to dialectical and meditative, but occasionally banal to the point of distraction. Like Lauren Hutton&amp;#8217;s gapped teeth this can be endearing rather than a flaw that would make lesser writers intolerable, but for a writer who can easily stretch a five minute event through 70 or 80 pages or a sentence to Proustian proportions, he seems willing to risk breaking the rhythm so crucial to his style for the sake of grounding his characters with an awkward, sometimes puzzling naturalistic whimsy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Dance and Dream&lt;/em&gt;, volume two of the &lt;em&gt;Your Face Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, Deza is ordered by his mysterious quasi-secret agent boss Tupra to search the toilets for a eurotrash diplomat and a dignitary&amp;#8217;s wife who&amp;#8217;ve gone astray together in a London nightclub. This bathroom scene &amp;#8211; a great deal of this second volume takes place in the toilet, although it might be more accurate to say it takes place inside Deza&amp;#8217;s mind &amp;#8211; begins on page 89 and ends nearly 70 pages later with Deza&amp;#8217;s thoughts just walking out the door of the toilet starting from page 121. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene encompasses not only his search of the nightclub&amp;#8217;s restrooms but ruminations on themes began in the novel&amp;#8217;s first volume &lt;em&gt;Fever and Spear&lt;/em&gt; such as meditations on violence and the Spanish Civil War, &amp;#8211; Deza&amp;#8217;s father survived the war from the losing side but not without a great deal of suffering &amp;#8211; remorse over estrangement from his wife who is still in Spain, and the tiny detail of a drop of blood, which occupies a central point in volume one and reappears in a different although related context here. The drop of blood takes on many symbolic possibilities but at the least it creates a bond between volume one and two, endowing the primary setting of both books with a physical puzzlement and the novelistic possibilities of questioning its source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we read Mar&amp;iacute;as, for his thoughts keyed by the events at hand, events that seem inconsequential for their only purpose is to provoke Deza, to spur his brooding, to lead us through his history or the history of his country, to watch from afar the way we humans treat one another, how we behave when we&amp;#8217;re alone. Besides these larger themes, Deza&amp;#8217;s mind dips into country song lyrics, women&amp;#8217;s legs &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;So there it was, that line of legs&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; and naturally, the state of the toilets. In a later scene in the restrooms for the disabled, he muses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;equally generous was the excellent lighting, intended, I assumed, to avoid the possibility of any stumbles, everything was new and spotless, gleaming and even welcoming, without any of the sordid elements so frequent in public toilets. It was admirable that people should show such respect for the disabled of Britain, that they did not cheerfully invade it and soil and besmirch it, as is the norm among men and optional among women.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strikes me as vaguely naive or even silly, yet a few moments later, more or less, banality veers into a nearly absurd act of violence. Here Mar&amp;iacute;as revels in the detail of the moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I saw the look on his face, the look of someone who thinks or knows he is dead; but since he was still alive, the image was one of infinite fear and struggle, mental struggle, perhaps of desire&amp;#8217; of childish, undisguised terror, his mouth must have dried instantly, as instantly as his face turned deathly pale, just as if someone had give his face a quick lick of grey or off-white or queasy-colored paint, or had thrown flour over him or perhaps talcum powder, it was rather like when swift clouds cast a shadow over the fields and a shudder runs through the flocks below, or like the hand that spreads the plague or closes the eyes of the deceased.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://theparisreview.com/viewinterview.php/prmMID/5680&quot;&gt;Paris Review&lt;/a&gt; interview that Mar&amp;iacute;as writes as he goes, intensively focusing on one section at a time, never looking back on a passage. It&amp;#8217;s easy to muse that the inconsistencies, if you could call them that, in his writing might be due to a lack of coffee one day, or too much, or a Laurel and Hardy movie on television, maybe a song on the radio, a random phone call from a friend. The fact that he pulls this off, at least in my view,  says a lot about Mar&amp;iacute;as. He is not a writer for everyone, indeed I&amp;#8217;d call him something of an intellectual elitist, both in tone and content, but to unflinchingly transcend story as he does puts him in a rare category of writer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Classics: On Edith Wharton by Roxana Robinson</title>
   <link href="/article/2008/07/15/classics-on-edith-wharton-by-roxana-robinson/"/>
   <updated>2008-07-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2008/07/15/classics-on-edith-wharton-by-roxana-robinson</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always been drawn to Edith Wharton&amp;#8217;s work, partly because of its astonishing combination of elegance and urgency, and partly because her world is so familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wharton and I come from similar backgrounds. I grew up with the rules that governed her: emotions were to be strictly controlled, pain was not to be acknowledged, and the rules of decorum were to be obeyed. I&amp;#8217;ve always been fascinated by her unblinking exegesis of all this, the way you are when someone breaks the rules, the way you are when you read something and think, &amp;#8220;What? Are you allowed to write about this?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wharton wrote about her world in a way that made it possible for me &amp;#8211; and for all of us who come after her &amp;#8211; to go into our own worlds still further, and to tease out the innermost reaches of pain and passion from the decorous woven fabric of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is excerpted with permission from the introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;amp;product_id=7152&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Stories of Edith Wharton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A writer&amp;#8217;s world both shelters and confines, and she must write her way both into and out of it. She must form her own world, but it will always be part of the one that formed her. It will always be both beginning and end of her journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edith Newbold Jones was born in 1862, in the family brownstone on West 23rd Street. Her forebears were Dutch, English and Huguenot &amp;#8211; a long line of successful merchants, bankers and lawyers. They were well-established, and at the time of her birth, Edith&amp;#8217;s family had lived in New York for nearly two hundred years. Old New York was an insular, tribal society, with a rigid caste system and a strict code of behaviour. The code of manners governed all aspects of behaviour, including frivolous ones of social comportment. At the core of this code, however, was a stern Puritan ethos of moral rectitude, self-reliance and a stoic disregard of pain. Edith learned the rules of this formal, restrained world, but she also felt the presence of another, unacknowledged one. This held emotions and ideas, and it seethed around her like an invisible mist. Wharton learned the power of the secret, forbidden realm, that the laws of decorum were set up to control and counteract. The conflict between these worlds &amp;#8211; the mannered, mandarin one, and the passionate, uncontrollable one  &amp;#8211; would provide the central dynamic of her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite moving to Europe, Wharton never gave up her American citizenship, however, and her deepest literary and  emotional connections always remained to her world &amp;#8211; Old New York. Her first novel, a historical romance called The Valley of Decision, was set in Italy. When it was published, in 1902, Henry James had famously advised her: &amp;#8220;Use the American subject! Do New York! There it is round you.&amp;#8221; But New York was already Wharton&amp;#8217;s subject; she had been &amp;#8220;doing&amp;#8221; it in stories for over a decade, and would continue throughout her career. New York was the center of her life, the place where she had struggled most ardently with conflicting claims of manners and passion, the place where her heart had beat most powerfully; where her soul had seemed most desperately constrained and her happiness most perilously at risk. In her work, New York received her greatest scrutiny, sternest criticism and deepest understanding. It was her greatest subject. In her New York stories, we find all of Wharton&amp;#8217;s great themes: stifled passion and the suffocating soul; the conflict between idealism and pragmatism; the charged erotic constellation of marriage, adultery, divorce and betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the richest and most fertile themes in Wharton&amp;#8217;s work was that of the complicated connection between love and pain. Wharton&amp;#8217;s own romantic history was not happy: her first engagement was broken off, not by her. A second romantic relationship, disappointingly, did not produce an offer. Her marriage to Teddy Wharton was neither passionate nor fulfilling, and ended in misery. Her brief erotic engagement with Morton Fullerton was wounding. These experiences are reflected in her fiction: rarely are her central male characters both sympathetic andeffective. Those who are sympathetic are often passive or uncommitted; those who are powerful are often evasive and opaque, solipsistic or brutal. The presence of a subtle emotional sadism runs like a dark undercurrent through Wharton&amp;#8217;s fiction. The same troubling theme is strikingly present in &amp;#8220;The Dilettante,&amp;#8221; written in 1903, long before her affair. Perhaps her most shocking story, &amp;#8220;The Dilettante&amp;#8221; is a subtle disquisition on cruelty. Thursdale, an idle and worldly bachelor, maintains an amitie amoureusewith Mrs. Vervain, an elegant divorcee. Cold, cynical and controlling, Thursdale considers their relationship, and the &amp;#8220;emotional training&amp;#8221; he has given Mrs. Vervain. As the narrative unfolds we learn of his decision to marry &amp;#8211; though not, of course, the well-schooled Mrs. Vervain. He has found a fresh, untainted young woman. With sublime effrontery he asks his mistress to support his marriage suit, persuading the young fiancee of Thursdale&amp;#8217;s worth. The lethal potency of the story arises partly from Mrs. Vervain&amp;#8217;s intelligence and vitality: she seems to have deliberately chosen this ghastly thralldom, this humiliating emotional martyrdom. In return for it she receives only a cruel intimacy. Love is what she wants, but it is not offered,  and she is too well-trained to make a scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wharton wrote brilliantly right up to the end of her life, and &amp;#8220;Roman Fever,&amp;#8221; of 1934, just three years before her death, is one of her great stories. It is not a quiet rumination on mortality, but the summoning up of rage, stifled passion, and sexuality: a remarkable work for a woman of seventy-two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the story is set entirely on a rooftop terrace in contemporary Rome, Old New York is a looming presence, and provides the background of &amp;#8220;two American ladies of ripe but well-cared for middle age.&amp;#8221; Friends since childhood, brownstone neighbours on East 73rd Street, now both widowed and the mothers of two marriageable daughters, the two sit      decorously watching the sunset &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;contemplating it in silence, with a sort of diffused serenity which might have been borrowed from the spring effulgence of the Roman skies.&amp;#8221;  Mrs. Slade thinks slightingly that her friend&amp;#8217;s late husband &amp;#8220;was &amp;#8211; well, just the duplicate of his wife. Museum specimens of old New York. Good looking, irreproachable, exemplary.&amp;#8221; Slowly, through dialogue and flashbacks, the two recall their young womanhood,  inducting us into its secret sisterhood as they remember a common visit to Rome some twenty-five years earlier. If New York represents a moribund rigidity, Rome embodies a dark, charged vitality, worldly and unfathomable. The fever of the title refers to malaria, a fatal nineteenth-century disease and a real threat before the Roman marshes were drained. Fever was the ostensible reason for keeping young women inside during the evenings. The risk of illness was real, but so was the other, unspoken reason for sequestration &amp;#8211; sexual adventure, with its terrifying consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated overlooking a ravishing twilit view of Rome, with its &amp;#8220;great accumulated wreckage of passion and splendor,&amp;#8221; the women are carried by the march of memory, to  the rising rhythm of animosity, through a landscape of jealousy and deception, illicit assignations, sexual thrall and unwed pregnancy. It is a virtuoso&amp;#8217;s performance, and Wharton&amp;#8217;s greatest story of old New York may be this one, set in Rome. Here Wharton reverts to her most enduring theme, the power of passion. It is passion that has driven the lives of these two decorous matrons, and it is passion that reveals itself anew, as they sit in the splendor of the Roman sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edith Wharton&amp;#8217;s lifetime spanned the Victorian era, the First World War, the Jazz Age, and the Depression. It was a period of enormous transitions, and subject to the competing forces of conservatism and modernism. The great changes she witnessed are reflected in her work, against the backdrop of old New York. Wharton&amp;#8217;s writing is difficult to place. She schooled herself by reading non-fiction: history, philosophy and scientific theory. This gave her a firm intellectual grounding and a rational, analytical approach to the world. She admired the novel of ideas, and the work of George Eliot and George Sand. Because of the elevated social circles of her characters, as well as the subtlety and nuance of her work, she has often been compared to Henry James, a mentor and friend. James was a very different sort of writer, however, and his vision was interior and more mysterious than hers. Wharton&amp;#8217;s work had more clarity and directness, more boldness and drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wharton wrote about the twentieth century, but, by her formal, ceremonial style and her belief in a moral order, she was linked inextricably to the nineteenth. The next generation of writers &amp;#8211; Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald, among others.  &amp;#8211; shared a sense of post-war disillusionment, and they experimented with literary styles that reflected the fractured rhythms of the twentieth century. Despite her decorous style, however, Wharton is anything but prim. Her work is informed by candor, clarity, and a deep  understanding of the great subversive force of the emotions. Perhaps only one for whom the life of the emotions has been so explicitly forbidden can truly understand the potency of that life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wharton&amp;#8217;s work was overlooked for many years because of its awkward placement, stranded between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Returned now to its rightful prominence in the history of American letters, it offers a profound and moving reflection on desire and its consequences, on freedom and its limits, in American life. Her New York stories show Edith Wharton&amp;#8217;s world as she knew it. They show the crystalline brilliance of Wharton&amp;#8217;s literary style; they show the intellectual reach and the complexity of her mind. They show the courage, depth, and compassion of her heart. They show her to be one of our greatest short story writers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dominique Fabre’s The Waitress Was New</title>
   <link href="/article/2008/06/02/dominique-fabre-s-the-waitress-was-new/"/>
   <updated>2008-06-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2008/06/02/dominique-fabre-s-the-waitress-was-new</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/waitress_thumb.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:18px&quot; alt=&quot;altimage&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;They never forget what they are, or all the things they have to do, but for a few minutes, maybe an hour or two, they put themselves between parentheses, and I bear the name of that thing in their lives.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To choose one word to describe Dominique Fabre&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archipelagobooks.org/bk.php?id=41&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Waitress Was New&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it would have to be &amp;#8220;quiet.&amp;#8221; A short novel of 117 pages, Fabre&amp;#8217;s first translated into English, &lt;em&gt;The Waitress Was New&lt;/em&gt; is a peek into the consciousness of a Parisian bartender over three days at the end of his career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story begins as Pierre is introduced to a new waitress at La Cercle, a small, non-descript restaurant on the outskirts of Paris:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	&amp;#8220;What I really wanted to say was &amp;#8216;Welcome to the Club,&amp;#8217; and then give her some tips on the questions she was probably going to ask. The boss isn&amp;#8217;t much of a talker, but he&amp;#8217;s him and I&amp;#8217;m me. I&amp;#8217;m only the oldest employee of Le Cercle, which is the caf&amp;eacute; where I work, across from the Asni&amp;eacute;res train station, where there&amp;#8217;s nothing to see but people coming and going out&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;She had a firm grip, when she let go I noticed she had a big wedding ring on her left hand, and I wondered if that&amp;#8217;s really where it&amp;#8217;s supposed to go. That was all too long ago for me, maybe I&amp;#8217;d forgotten. Still, I&amp;#8217;d stayed married for eight years, I was a young man then. I kept my ring on at first. Then I put it in my nightstand drawer. I lost a lot of illusions, but not her. My ex remarried, lived happily; and had two children. Then unhappily, and still two children. Then we lost touch. Her name was Marie, like my adoptive mother. The boss looked around, he&amp;#8217;d picked up his cigarillo again.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierre is matter-of-factly attuned to his environment because he is the one person not passing through. He&amp;#8217;s a fixture like the bar itself. He listens more than he talks, he observes more than he listens. But for his attentiveness he doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to learn much. He acts as though he understand others&amp;#8217; relationships but his own are withered, distant or shallow. He thinks he gets what&amp;#8217;s going on around him but then is sideswiped by the truth. Much of the novel surrounds the disappearance of &amp;#8220;the boss&amp;#8221; (which in French is, I think, &amp;#8220;le boss&amp;#8221;) and everyone&amp;#8217;s speculation, including the boss&amp;#8217;s wife, that he&amp;#8217;s having an affair with one of the restaurant&amp;#8217;s former waitresses. Pierre stumbles confidently through what seems to him a given only to be met later by the truth and throughout he never truly doubts himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In depicting someone on the side of society (not on the margins, just side, if you will) Fabre slips into a barely comfortable pathos. Pierre is neither particularly likable or unlikeable and his existence appears without purpose or meaning. The affect is a lack of tension such that we pity Pierre &amp;#8211; the man can&amp;#8217;t even bring himself to masturbate &amp;#8211; but don&amp;#8217;t care about the outcome of the story. This is why I think of &lt;em&gt;The Waitress Was New&lt;/em&gt; as quiet. It doesn&amp;#8217;t try to draw attention to itself, just like Pierre. If we had any doubts of Pierre as something of an anti-hero, Fabre casts him firmly against Pierre&amp;#8217;s own reading material that he, naturally, learns about through a customer at the bar: Primo Levi&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;If this is a Man&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8220;the story of a Jewish Italian resistance fighter who lived through the concentration camps, he wanted to bear witness.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Now there&amp;#8217;s somebody I&amp;#8217;d like to have as a customer,&amp;#8221; says Pierre of Levi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/bartender_thumb.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:18px&quot; alt=&quot;altimage&quot; /&gt; Where Fabre excels is accreting pieces of Pierre&amp;#8217;s world into a somewhat whole portrait. While the drama is not exactly intense during our brief time with Pierre and Le Cercle, Fabre wastes not a word, packing in layers of detail in every paragraph. Looking at the quote above (beginning with &amp;#8220;What I really wanted to say), Pierre gives us glimpses of the new waitress (married, probably strong-willed), the boss (silent type, which might be odd for a restaurant owner, owns a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris, smokes cigarillos), Pierre&amp;#8217;s ex-wife (divorced, happy, two children, unhappy) and himself (long-time employee of Le Cercle with a fondness for his job, older, divorcee, adopted). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, our observations are limited to what goes through Pierre&amp;#8217;s mind, leaving sketches of the boss, the new waitress, the bosses wife and other characters merely impressions. We can only come as close to them as Pierre and he is nothing more than an onlooker on these lives, but still the richness lies in what we don&amp;#8217;t know about them. I suspect in reading this novel that I&amp;#8217;ve come a little closer to a life about which I knew nothing before, the kind of life that I might pass by with little thought. I may not be any closer than Pierre comes to his customers, filling in blanks where needed with imagination, but that is an oddly compelling pastime. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Considering the Classics: re Kipling</title>
   <link href="/article/2007/11/05/considering-the-classics-re-kipling/"/>
   <updated>2007-11-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2007/11/05/considering-the-classics-re-kipling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We all have our favorite books, and not a few of us are probably influenced by those we read when we were children. But often when we go back and look again, they&amp;#8217;re disappointing; we see their tricks and the manipulations of an author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those books, though, were remarkably able to touch both children and adults, and for me, there is nothing quite like Kipling&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;The Jungle Book,&amp;#8221; published in 1894, which affected me as a child and still has a hold on me. I particularly mean the first one (he published &amp;#8220;The Second Jungle Book&amp;#8221; a year later) and its three stories about Mowgli, the wolf-boy, although it&amp;#8217;s hard not to love &amp;#8220;Rikki-tikki-tavi,&amp;#8221; which records the life-saving battle between a loyal mongoose and a particularly nasty cobra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You read these stories today and you say, &amp;#8220;Wow!&amp;#8221; Mowgli is a far more interesting character than his epigone, Tarzan, even if he has power approaching those of a superhero. (He can speak bird and snake and tiger, and so on; and, when the time comes, learns human speech.) Kipling doesn&amp;#8217;t anthropomorphize, or not much, but Mowgli&amp;#8217;s friendships with Bagheera, the gentle, deadly black panther, and Baloo, the professorial bear, and the wolves who reared him, are touching and realized. Kaa, the rock python, and the loathsome Bandar-log &amp;#8211; the amoral monkey tribe &amp;#8211; are grand fictional characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kipling was such an accomplished stylist, too; in the 1890s &amp;#8211; in the time after Dickens and before Arnold Bennett &amp;#8211; he wrote clean, elegant sentences that leapt beyond the stilted prose his place and time. Hemingway might have written this from &amp;#8220;Tiger-Tiger,&amp;#8221; the third Mowgli story: &amp;#8220;At one end stood a little village, and at the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds, and stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe.&amp;#8221; In that story, Kipling does something that I never understood when I was a kid: He writes from Mowgli&amp;#8217;s point of view, but also through the eyes of Indian villagers, who are startled by this boy (by now about twelve or thirteen) who can&amp;#8217;t communicate and appears to have bites all over his body.  And Kipling being Kipling, he stage-manages a fine adventure in which Mowgli finally confronts Shere Khan, the vengeful tiger who has stalked him since he was a baby, left in the jungle and adopted by the wolf pack.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Writing in (computer) Isolation</title>
   <link href="/article/2007/08/08/writing-in-computer-isolation/"/>
   <updated>2007-08-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2007/08/08/writing-in-computer-isolation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left;margin-right: 18px&quot; src=&quot;http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/twkarsh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tennessee Williams&quot; /&gt; Whither the poor typewriter whose few remaining acolytes hoard ribbons and spare parts. Frankly, there’s no way my wife would let me clang away at a typewriter anyway – solitude is hard enough to come by without the click-click-clacking to wake the kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of writing on a cheap (paper!) notebook and a soft &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.staedtler.com/Mars_Lumograph_gb.Staedtler?ActiveID=2213&quot;&gt;pencil&lt;/a&gt;, but at some point every story begs for the spit and polish of type. That presents some problems for me because I make my living working on the computer, read the paper on the computer, read blogs, and so on and all those things are just a click away, and each of those clicks has many more clicks. You know of what I speak?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;margin-left: 8px&quot; src=&quot;http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/Screenshot_6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tennessee Williams&quot; /&gt; I once &lt;a href=&quot;http://chekhovsmistress.com/index.php/article/mac_the_new_typewriter_for_writers/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about Macs being the new typewriter. That’s when I had a Powerbook, which has the smoothest keyboard of any computer known to man. Now I use a MacBook, which is more comfy because it’s smaller and cheaper. The keyboard takes a bit more heft than its double-the-price sibling, but I’ve grown use to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what’s the good of a keyboard if it’s forever leading you away from the glorious path of writing? None, I tell you. I know! So this is what I’ve done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macs allow you to set up users. Each user has their own log-in and profile – it’s really very much like being on a separate computer. I set up my alter-ego writer guy profile with parental controls so that I can only access a couple of applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bartastechnologies.com/products/copywrite/&quot;&gt;Copywrite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copywrite is billed as “project management for writers,” which it is, but I can’t say that I use it so elaborately. I primarily use it because it just gives you a blank page with few formatting options, full screen writing, and “versioning,” an invaluable feature because I like to freeze one version (without having to save a new file) before making substantial edits. It does have a lot of other features, like categories, etc. but I don’t use those. I just write with it. I do like having all my documents in front of me if I want to switch what I’m working on, which is an obvious difference between a program like this and, say, that devil’s child, MS Word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Safari Web browser, also with parental controls set so that I can only access one Web site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. I can write. I can look things up in the dictionary, and I can print. I am my own parent and I’ve put myself on restriction. It may seem a little silly, but I even write in a Courier font, which in a way is a reminder that I’m supposed to be writing as though on a typewriter; that means write forward – not writing over what I’ve just written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p(small). &lt;em&gt;While I’m mentioning writing programs, I should mention that I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marinersoftware.com/sitepage.php?page=85&quot;&gt;MacJournal&lt;/a&gt; for day-to-day writing, such as blog posts or anything else relatively short when I just need to be one second away from creating a new document. Again, the biggest feature here is that there’s no formatting and all your documents are in front of you instead of opening new ones. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blue-tec.com/ulysses/&quot;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; is another I’ve used, but seems to have too many features for my purposes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
First published in 1957 in Poland, Bacacay is a collection of twelve short stories by Witold Gombrowicz (1904-1968), one of the major European literary figures of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;mdash; from Oscar Wilde&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impulses drive the stories of Witold Gombrowicz&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/097639507X/?tag=bookenompolic-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bacacay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where characters abandon themselves wholly to their temptations like children who can&amp;#8217;t stop acting up, even after getting into trouble, pushing their parents&amp;#8217; limits while surely knowing their punishment will worsen. In &amp;#8220;Lawyer Kraykowski&amp;#8217;s Dancer&amp;#8221; a brief incident (where the lawyer K humiliates our protagonist) becomes the impetus for obsessive stalking, growing in intensity and inevitability of conflict, until at one point the lawyer confronts his nameless haunter with frustrated threats of a beating, only to be met with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was unable to speak. I was happy. I received it into myself like a communion, and I closed my eyes. In silence I merely bent over and offered my back. I waited &amp;#8211; and experienced some of those perfect moments known only to one who truly has but few days ahead of him.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last sentence vaguely reminds me of the kind of statement you might find Marcel Proust having made, and while their writing is entirely dissimilar, I think both Proust&amp;#8217;s and  Gombrowicz&amp;#8217;s willingness to penetrate the psyche farther than most puts these writers in a shared light, as well does the centrality of details in their work. The most subtle story in Bacacay is &amp;#8220;A Premeditated Crime.&amp;#8221; Here a lawyer travels to visit a man on business, only to find that he has just died. The lawyer becomes suspicious of the family and grows paranoid with every new piece of evidence, facts folding in on themselves until there is no logical conclusion other than murder. He finally pushes the dead man&amp;#8217;s son to confess, only to realize at that moment there was no crime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I realized that I gone too far, that I had gotten up to a little too much mischief &amp;#8211; and, in deep waters, tired, exhausted by so much effort, so many faces made, I suddenly became a child, a helpless little boy, and I had a wish to confess to my big brother my mistake and the trouble I had caused.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;You see,&amp;#8217; I said, and my lips were a little out of control, &amp;#8216;there&amp;#8217;s a certain stumbling block here&amp;#8230;a certain obstacle &amp;#8211; of a purely formal character, as it happens &amp;#8211; nothing of significance. The things is&amp;#8217; &amp;#8211; I already had my hand on the door handle &amp;#8211; &amp;#8216;that actually the body shows no signs of asphyxiation. Physically speaking &amp;#8211; he wasn&amp;#8217;t asphyxiated at all, but rather died of an ordinary heart attack. 	The neck, you know, the neck!&amp;#8230;The neck was untouched!&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Gombrowicz&amp;#8217;s writing speaks so well for itself, doesn&amp;#8217;t it) Here, the dead man&amp;#8217;s neck becomes a central point of the story, and it is that treatment which is part of Gombrowicz&amp;#8217;s art, dwelling on a detail about which our perception changes later in the story. In &amp;#8220;A Premeditated Crime&amp;#8221; as often happens in his stories, even the minor characters are maddened to the point of absurdity; so much so that you feel closed in, surrounded and helpless in this world Gombrowicz created, grotesque but actually very representative too of real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;#8220;Dinner at Countess Pavahoke&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; a fashionable &amp;#8220;meatless&amp;#8221; dinner becomes orgiastic while the narrator, an outsider grateful at first to be there, is quietly appalled as the others get carried away with the cauliflower soup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The baron accompanied her gallantly, bent over his plate, slurping and smacking his lips with all his might &amp;#8211; and the old marchioness did her best to keep up, chewing and swallowing huge mouthfuls, evidently worried they would take her plate away before she had eaten the best morsels!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extraordinary, sudden image of guzzling &amp;#8211; I cannot put it otherwise &amp;#8211; of &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; guzzling, in &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a house, this awful transition, this diminished seventh chord, shook the foundations of my being to such an extent I was unable to restrain myself and I sneezed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s humor in the sneeze, but also pretext for discoveries important to the story. As pretext, it&amp;#8217;s weak, but easily written off to the quirky nature of Gombrowicz&amp;#8217;s writing. Here again, the cauliflower soup becomes central (in ways I won&amp;#8217;t reveal) and the tale becomes wildly symbolic of the brutality of privilege and class differences, and perhaps how stifling privilege can be, without ever sacrificing the story to be told &amp;#8211; or the opportunity to take things a bit too far &amp;#8211; as when in &amp;#8220;The Events on the Banbury&amp;#8221; the ship&amp;#8217;s captain says: &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t forget, Mr. Smith, that independent of the punishment the guilty party should eat the eye that was poked out. Nautical customs require it.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nearly all of Gombrowicz&amp;#8217;s stories are suffused with sensuality, many carry their character&amp;#8217;s sexuality and sexual tension close to the surface, often uncomfortably so (remember too that most of these stories were written around the 1930&amp;#8217;s). On the Banbury, a ship doomed to mutiny, the stormy force of open seas grow more fierce along with the crew&amp;#8217;s sexual tension until, inevitably, release comes at the end. Earlier, while the seas are calm, boredom reigns but madness is never far from the surface. The protagonist, Mr. Zantman (a name that may carry connotations of a fish, appropriate here, since he never intended to be on the Banbury in the first place, but &lt;em&gt;swam&lt;/em&gt; out to the ship looking for his intended ship) alternates between observation, insinuation and repulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Recently I had noticed that the sailors were performing bizarre movements with their torsos; specifically, as they bent over their rags they would suddenly lean on their hands, stiffen their legs and arch their backs, just like certain earthworms do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not ask anyone for an explanation. I put it down as a &amp;#8216;novel way to pass the time.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, in reporting what he sees as a &amp;#8220;conspiracy&amp;#8221; on board, Zantman says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;You&amp;#8217;re all thinking about the same thing. You have a yen for goodness knows what, and I&amp;#8217;m in the way &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m a hindrance, isn&amp;#8217;t that the case? &amp;#8211; my modesty is a hindrance. That&amp;#8217;s why everything around here either fawns or threatens, peeps or mocks; that&amp;#8217;s the reason for the constant importunings and the fact that there&amp;#8217;s only one unchangin thought &amp;#8211; oh, one unchanging thought!&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/030012368X/?tag=bookenompolic-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Guide to Philosophy in Six Hours and Fifteen Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Gombrowicz writes &amp;#8220;Philosophy begins to deal with consciousness as something fundamental. Imagine an absolute night, with a single object. If this object does not encounter a consciousness capable of sensing its existence, then it does not exist.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the story &amp;#8220;Adventures&amp;#8221; our protagonist falls into the ocean from his ship and is picked up &amp;#8211; and held captive in what becomes more submission than imprisonment &amp;#8211; by a &amp;#8220;white black man&amp;#8221; on a yacht. He is put into a &amp;#8220;glass bubble the shape of an egg&amp;#8221; and is tossed to drift in the sea. The second time this black man captures him, he is put into a steel sphere to be plunged to the bottom of the ocean. &amp;#8220;And so I was to be the only living creature who would experience the gentle thud of the sphere against the ocean bed&amp;#8230;The only one who would know absolute darkness, deadness, despair.&amp;#8221; In the pitch blackness of his &amp;#8220;tomb&amp;#8221; his &amp;#8220;individuality peeped out from that awful underwater abyss so differently from what it had been like in the light of day.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Adventures&amp;#8221; my favorite story in &lt;em&gt;Bacacay&lt;/em&gt; grows more outrageous, yet inevitably ends up every bit as circular as the protagonist&amp;#8217;s initial driftings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much made of Gombrowicz&amp;#8217;s use of the grotesque, potentially alienating readers who would find upon reading him a master of psychological drama, humor and pathos. I have no idea what sort of literature Gombrowicz had exposure to in his young years while writing these stories, but there&amp;#8217;s so much here that is reminiscent of Wilde, Poe, Wells and others. I bet that if Gombrowicz were American (or English, and so on) rather than Polish his name would be every bit as famous as those authors. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The People’s Act of Love, by James Meek</title>
   <link href="/article/2007/01/18/the-people-s-act-of-love-by-james-meek/"/>
   <updated>2007-01-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2007/01/18/the-people-s-act-of-love-by-james-meek</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Could we not say of all such examples that… the monstrous always excites wonder.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
      - Longinus, On the Sublime&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While at one of my favorite bookstores, &lt;a href=&quot;http://threelives.com/&quot; title=&quot;Three Lives and Company&quot;&gt;Three Lives and Company&lt;/a&gt;, “The People’s Act of Love” came up. Several of us chimed in enthusiastically and I reminded myself that this was one of the (many) books I never managed to write about last year. So here I attempt amends if for only because I think you will enjoy the book. Last year word got out that Johnny Depp would be bringing The People’s Act of Love to film, which seems both appropriate and daunting. Modern audiences can stomach just about anything, but a book that includes castration and cannibalization might be hard to translate with, er, taste. Nontheless, the book, which was longlisted for the Booker, has a cinematic flair and is well worth reading before the film is released, reportedly in 2009.
Primarily set in the remote Siberian village of Yazyk during the tumultuous years after the 1917 Russian revolution, “The People’s Act of Love” tells the calamitously converging stories of four people: One is Mutz, an officer in a Czech military unit  - led by a murderous sociopath - who is caught up in another country’s civil war. Mutz is long overdue for going home and well past believing in the means of his superior. The independent Anna Petrovna (incidentally, the name of a character in Chekhov’s first play, Platonov) is a mysteriously out of place woman whose purpose for living in the town is unknown except for one other person. And then there’s Balashov, leader of an Angelic religious sect who believes the only way to be close to God is to eschew all opportunities for fornication, that is, physically remove the possibility.
All of these characters live in a tense coexistence with their motivations veiled until Sarin arrives, literally walking in from upper Siberia with a man’s severed hand in his pocket. Sarin was a student who lost his youth and the woman he loved to revolution and has set out in the world to deliver the People, he believes, to the truth.  His arrival, which coincides with the death of a Shaman being held captive, is the catalyst for tensions to explode. The novel is built upon these characters and the collision of their individual philosophies.
James Meek, who’s written two other novels and was a foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union during the ‘90s, has researched this book well. He tells us in an afterward that many of the novel’s elements are a matter of historical yet widely unknown fact, which is interesting given their fantastical and violent nature. To tally the many heinous acts in “The People’s Act of Love”  - severed hands, toes, scrotum, thumbs, liver, etc. - would seem to me to miss the point, but it’s hard to resist as they add up and we begin to wonder if we’re not at a campfire listening to ghost stories. Closer to the point though, is the moral impetus behind these monstrous acts. It is a time of war and a time of revolution, a time when ugly terrible things become ordinary.
Meek poses questions through his characters: Is love a good reason to kill? Is there a difference between one who kills as a sociopath and one who kills for religion or patriotism, or love? “…Is there any cause which would justify a man butchering and eating his companion in the wilderness?” one character asks, adding, “who raises the companion for that purpose, like a farmer fattening a hog?” Does the question change when “the fate of the world rested” on this man, if he “is the will of the people. He’s the hundred thousand curses they utter every day against their enslavement.”? “To hold such a man,” he continues, “ to the same standards as ordinary men would be strange, like putting wolves on trial for killing elk…”
The other side of that questions is absolute pacifism and here idealistic brutality meets angelic, or perhaps stoic passivity. In this lovely passage, Balashov explains his journey toward God and a new life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#8220;I walked for hours, trying to be as quiet as possible and trying to move deeper into the forest. It was a warm night. I curled up on a bed of last year&amp;#8217;s leaves between two tree roots and went to sleep. I woke up from a nightmare just when it was getting light. I had dreamed the events of the battle...as the shells began to explode I felt as if I was being bitten by some small, vicious animal, from within, as if it was just about to burst through my skin. I stood up with a shout in a pattering of falling leaves and pulled off my vest and ran my hands over my body. There was no new mark, not even a graze. I took off my boots and the rest of my clothes and sat naked on the root, trying to find the wound I was sure was there. I found nothing. In my heart I was not surprised because I did not feel as if I had lost anything, blood or flesh. It felt more as if I had gained something I should not have, which had not been there before. I had seen the best part of the two hundred comrades and their horses cut down like grass in a few minutes, and I had escaped without a cut. I should have been on my knees, for days, thanking God for his mercy. But I did not feel saved. I felt filthy inside, as if my soul would never be clean again, be there ever so much fasting and prayer, and a weight which would never let my soul float free of blind killing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a man who has lived through battle and chosen a monastic life is faced with violence, what does he do? Can he go against the nature of man? Meek opens the book epigraphically with these words of the writer Andrei Platonov: “Busy remaking the world, man forgot to remake himself.” If this quote stands before the book as a challenge of meaning, then where does a man who so wholly and irrevokably remade himself fit? If this were a different novel - perhaps one much longer and written by a Russian - we might emerge with an attempt at more full understanding (which, for something along those lines I point you to Mesa Selimovic’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDeath-Dervish-Writings-Unbound-Europe%2Fdp%2F0810112973%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1169185051%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;amp;tag=bookenompolic-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&quot;&gt;“Death and the Dervish”&lt;/a&gt;), but Meek stops short trying to answer these questions. Maybe the demands of the story, or an editor, left ideas on the cutting room floor. Still, that is only a qualm with what the book could be and not with what it is, which is an enjoyable, even if horific and dismal, story written in fluid prose. If its gruesomeness pulls us in, the moral complexity of the characters is what makes the story memorable. As testament, I’ll say that I wrote this piece a full year after reading the book, having but a few notes. Much of the story and characters are as vivid in my mind today as they were when I read the book last year.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why You Should Buy Fair Trade: The Coffee Book, by Nina Luttinger and Gregory Dicum</title>

   <id>/article/2006/11/29/why-you-should-buy-fair-trade-the-coffee-book-by-nina-luttinger-and-gregory-dicum</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1595580603%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1595580603%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chekhovsmistress.com/images/uploads/1317.cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;190&quot; height=&quot;190&quot; style=&quot;border: 0;float:left;padding:0 8px 0 0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In 1777 Frederick the Great issued a Coffee and Beer Manifesto, proclaiming “It is disgusting to notice the increase in the quantity of coffee used by my subjects, and the amount of money that goes out of the country in consequence…this must be prevented.” Ultimately, when the government found they couldn’t prohibit coffee drinking, they monopolized coffee roasting to the point that commoners could no longer afford it, resorting to things like barley, chicory, corn and dried figs in its stead. And so goes the history of coffee: the people love it, the powerful want to control it or get a piece of the action.
Written by Nina Luttinger and Gregory Dicum, she a sustainable business consultant, he a writer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1595580603%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1595580603%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Coffee Book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; traces the common thread of “Kaveh,” as it was called during the days of the Ottoman Empire, from thousands of years ago to today as a politically charged drink and profitably exploitable trade. Readers will find little on the cover to indicate so, but The Coffee Book has a decided point of view. In describing the growing popularity of coffee in 20th century America, Luttinger and Dicum say…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#8220;Indoors, away from the rhythm of the seasons, the new America increasingly moved to the rhythm of machines. Here, coffee was the ideal drink: it gave that kick you needed to spend sixteen hours tightening screws on a mind-numbing, dangerous factory floor or pounding away at a keyboard. Coffee has always been the perfect compliment to dehumanizing industrialization.&amp;#8221;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there’s little sign of that impassioned reverence for the beverage often found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://jimseven.com/?p=228&quot; title=&quot;books&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; for coffee lovers. That’s because &lt;em&gt;The Coffee book&lt;/em&gt; is not so much about coffee the drink, but coffee the bean, the powerful drug, profitable commodity and social elixir.
Yet there is passion here. In a world where we consumers are indeed away from “the rhythm of the seasons” and more specifically away from the origins of the products we buy, &lt;em&gt;The Coffee Book&lt;/em&gt; is a whole-hearted attempt to connect us with an understanding of just how far those little beans travel before they make it into our mugs, often cultivated through the back-breaking toil of an underpaid worker equally disconnected from the end user of his labor’s produce, who may pay as much for one latte as he or she makes in a day.
Part of the problem is that coffee “cherries,” as they are called in their early stages, are grown in far away and often poorer countries. To get to our tummies in the form of a cup of joe they potentially travel through a network of growers, mills, intermediaries, government run marketing boards, exporters, importers or brokers, traders, roasters, distributors and then a cafe or other outlet. Most every player along the way takes a cut and each has some degree of pricing power that ultimately disfavors the farmer because the growing process takes a long time and is difficult to synchronize with market prices.
To complicate this scenario, there are various ways to cultivate coffee beans and in an attempt to meet marketing demand - to the tune of 15 billion pounds of green coffee per year - many growers have resorted to industrial scale plantations and “technification” methods, which produce higher yielding varieties that can be grown in the sun, but also result in a greater environmental impact. Traditional coffee farming is done on a small scale in a complex agrosystem dominated by shade trees and often with generational methods of controlling pests rather than environmentally harsh chemicals, which, because of the farm’s biodiversity, are not necessary.
The large industrial companies that control much of the world’s imports of coffee benefit from higher yielding methods and until recently a majority of consumers didn’t mind the trade-off in quality to keep the price of their daily drink low. Zoom forward to today’s affluent “artisanal” and activist buying culture and in steps the traditional farmer’s savior - maybe. 
Fair Trade certified coffee reaches you through fewer hands than before, often skipping such intermediaries as traders and distributors. Certification also guarantees that growers are paid a floor price for their produce as well as other stipulations such as worker-owned cooperatives and investment in social development. These expenses should be seen as investment in human capital at the least and if you’re inclined to think so, as a moral imperative for the difficult labor that goes into something we generally take for granted.
Fair Trade Coffee as something official has been in existence less than a decade, but thanks to a vociferous body of activist consumers, that and other sustainable methods are coming into the mainstream. Starbucks is now the largest roaster of Fair Trade coffee in the U.S., yet, as the book points out and I’ve noticed myself, it would seem there are more brochures about Fair Trade in their stores than the actual coffee. The mixed message here is a sign that this movement toward awareness and sustainable culture (I chose that phrase carefully) is only getting underway.
The hopeful byproduct of expecting and getting quality foodstuff must come with an awareness of where it comes from and at least partial responsibility for its continued existence. Admittedly, this attitude is new to me; &lt;em&gt;The Coffee Book&lt;/em&gt; came at a particular point in my own awareness of these issues and has made a general tickle of thought into a more informed and actionable opinion.
I didn’t begin reading &lt;em&gt;The Coffee Book&lt;/em&gt; on page one because that was the “history of” section populated, I figured, with quaint tales of trade routes and kings usually required in books of this ilk. I began on a later chapter and only when I saw &lt;em&gt;The Coffee Book’s&lt;/em&gt; comprehensiveness and overarching goal did I read through the center, go back to the beginning and then finally read through the final chapters that brought all the history, political and industry talk into focus on today’s American market.
As is obvious by now, I am sympathetic to the views of the authors’. The book, as I said, has an opinion and not all readers will be comfortable with that. My education is in economics so you might say I’m a trained skeptic, so at times I wondered if I might benefit from a different perspective, although I’m not sure where exactly that would come from. And despite its point of view, the book is thorough enough that readers will feel as though the argument before them is thoughtful and has a higher aim than merely pointing fingers at the bad guys.
My only complaint about &lt;em&gt;The Coffee Book &lt;/em&gt;is the lack of action asked of the reader. With a clear aim at elucidating the market powers that have driven mediocrity and exploitation in the coffee business, Luttinger and Dicum leave us with a hopeful picture of an industry moving toward bringing Fair Trade, Organic and Shade Grown coffees into the mainstream, yet don’t supply us with our way of being a part of the movement besides a few resources hidden away in the notes and bibliography.
So, I’ll offer a few places for you to start supporting Fair Trade:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transfairusa.org/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.transfairusa.org/&quot;&gt;TransFair USA&lt;/a&gt; has a “shop” section to find local and online stores as well as a wealth of information on the subject.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gorillacoffee.com/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.gorillacoffee.com/&quot;&gt;Gorilla Coffee&lt;/a&gt; is a Brooklyn micro-roaster who sells excellent Fair Trade coffee.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fairtraderesource.org/resources/index.html&quot; title=&quot;http://www.fairtraderesource.org/resources/index.html&quot;&gt;The Fair Trade Resource Network&lt;/a&gt;
In addition to supporting small local companies that sell Free Trade coffee, you might also consider asking your Starbucks barista to brew you Fair Trade coffee too. As much as I like to support indies, the green mermaid seems unavoidable  - and is in fact the only source of Free Trade coffee in some countries - and to the extent you do shop there, continued pressure on the company to bring Fair Trade into the mainstream may have a greater impact than anything else.
I would be remiss in not mentioning in this line-up the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenewpress.com/&quot; title=&quot;The New Press&quot;&gt;The New Press&lt;/a&gt; who published this book. They are a not-for profit publisher putting out books in the public interest. I can’t imagine too many non-academic publishers putting out a book like this and I think it’s important to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Soundtrack to Pynchon’s “Against the Day”: Glass’s Plutonian Ode with Allen</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000BRF9T4%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000BRF9T4%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot; title=&quot;Symphony No. 6, Plutonian Ode&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/plutonianode.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0;float:left;padding:0 8px 0 0&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;What new element before us unborn in nature? Is there a new thing under the sun? &amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt; - Allen Ginsberg &amp;#8220;Plutonian Ode&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I recommend as a Soundtrack to Pynchon&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=159420120X%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/159420120X%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot; title=&quot;Against the Day&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Against the Day,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; Philip Glass&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000BRF9T4%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000BRF9T4%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot; title=&quot;Symphony No. 6, Plutonian Ode&quot;&gt;Symphony No. 6 &amp;#8220;Plutonian Ode&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; with Allen Ginsberg. You&amp;#8217;re thinking this is absurd - I know - to say a modern symphony connoting nuclear disaster can capture, musically, themes from a book that begins and ends before plutonium was discovered, but I say to you it&amp;#8217;s striking how well the music fits with the book.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, the word itself is a great play: &amp;#8220;Plutonium&amp;#8221; is of course a radioactive element discovered (named) in 1942 for the planet Pluto because plutonium follows neptuniam in the periodic table of elements just as the (erstwhile) planet Pluto orbits beyond Neptune in the solar system. &amp;#8220;Plutonian,&amp;#8221; the name of Ginsberg&amp;#8217;s ode, refers to Pluto, God of the world of the dead, deep within the earth, infernal, dismal. Get it? The two are intertwined in the Ode and most certainly in real life - Plutonian comes up in &lt;i&gt;Against the Day&lt;/i&gt; on page 154 in context of the &amp;#8220;DOLEFUL&amp;#8221; metropolis (NYC?) where &amp;#8220;Fire and blood were about to roll like fate upon the complacent multitudes...&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Besides the mood evoked by the title - and I haven&amp;#8217;t finished the book yet - I do feel as though much of the scientific discussion in &lt;em&gt;Against the Day&lt;/em&gt; premeditates the Atomic age and the hold it has on our lives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The music itself has a grandeur - you may know Philip Glass scores a lot of films - that befits an epic like Pynchon&amp;#8217;s and its grandeur, it seems, is self-mocking in such a way to belie the seriousness of its underlying themes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;m not, by the way, suggesting that you sit down with the music while you read the book - you&amp;#8217;d get nowhere with either. The symphony - particularly the version with the Ginsberg reading that Glass superimposed over the music with Lauren Flanigan singing the very same libretto (poem) - stands on its own. But I often think about music and books or art forms that in their specific details relate to one another, throwing a different light on your thinking about them or expressing the story in a different way. I think the &lt;em&gt;Plutonian Ode&lt;/em&gt; does that.
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Laird Hunt’s The Exquisite</title>
   <link href="/article/2006/08/29/laird-hunt-s-the-exquisite/"/>
   <updated>2006-08-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2006/08/29/laird-hunt-s-the-exquisite</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;!{float:left;margin-right:18px}http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1566891876.01.&lt;em&gt;SCMZZZZZZZ&lt;/em&gt;.jpg(altimage)! If you liked Charlie Kaufman’s “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” or Alejandro Amenábar’s “Open Your Eyes (remade as Vanilla Sky), then I’d bet you’ll like Laird Hunt’s latest novel &lt;em&gt;The Exquisite&lt;/em&gt;. I know I’m getting off cheap by putting a novel in a category with a couple of films, but those two exceptional movies came to mind when reading the book. Like those films, &lt;em&gt;The Exquisite&lt;/em&gt; is a quirky ‘don’t-know-exactly-where-reality-begins-and-ends’ type of story, which is quite appealing to a mindset that’s open to the “improbable,” as Hunt aptly characterizes his book.
I knew I would like &lt;em&gt;The Exquisite&lt;/em&gt; when I saw the epigraph quoting Fernando Pessoa’s The Book of Disquiet: ”&lt;em&gt;I fainted during a bit of my life. I regain consciousness without any memory of what I was, and the memory of who I was suffers for having been interrupted. There is in me a confused notion of an unknown interval, a futile effort on the part of my memory to want to find that other memory. I don’t connect myself with myself. If I’ve lived, I forget having known it.&lt;/em&gt;” Epigraphs often mean more to the author than to the reader, but once you’ve read &lt;em&gt;The Exquisite&lt;/em&gt; you realize just how well this quote fits, so much so that you can imagine the narrator speaking those words himself. “Once upon a time I was someone then that stopped,” he begins.
Henry, our unlikable unreliable narrator lives in the East Village in New York City. He’s something of a ne’er-do-well who slips into a seedy existence after his girlfriend leaves him and he falls in with an odd gang of fake murderers. Now, when I say fake murderers I may mean that they did fake murders, or they were fake murderers, or their fake murders were fake, or something like that, but I’ll leave that for you to decide when you read the book. Much of the story centers around one of those fake murderers whose murder doesn’t seem to be so fake, who happens to be the namesake of a petty thief immortalized - maybe literally - in the Rembrandt painting &lt;em&gt;The Anatomy Lesson&lt;/em&gt; as the subject of a public dissection.
Aris Kindt, this namesake of the man dissected for posterity, enters Henry’s life with a tinge of risk and eroticism that he finds at once perplexing and comfortable:
bq. “It was this deep enjoyment of orchestrated experiences in which pain and pleasure lay tightly coiled that had prompted Mr. Kindt, I presumed, to take out a membership at the Eleventh Street Russian baths, a venerable mobster-frequented establishment where what I took to be blast furnaces filled with boiling, beet-red lumps of flesh coexisted with sinister massage cabinets and a deep icy pool…It was Mr. Kindt’s rule, one that Tulip and I were both happy to comply with, that if we came with him we did all of it. So it was that, to my surprising delight, I had a huge guy sit on my back, soap me up, whack me with oak branches, and time and again pour near-frozen water on me…”
When we meet Mr. Kindt, he is sitting in the dark, naked, strapped to a heart monitor as Henry is burglarizing him. He doesn’t get any less strange as the story goes on, not in any of his incarnations, and neither do any of his equally odd colleagues, all of whom seem to have stepped out of a Quentin Tarantino movie (this is my last movie mention, I swear); like Cornelius, who wears a hunting cape, or the “contortionist twins,” or Tulip the beautiful tattoo artist, and finally a bartender enigmatically named Job  - I imagine after Job in the Bible or perhaps of the Robert Heinlein book, &lt;em&gt;Job: a Comedy of Justice&lt;/em&gt;, or maybe just job, like an act of crime - who also seems to appear with different names.
In fact, many people show up with different names or as different people in &lt;em&gt;The Exquisite&lt;/em&gt;. The main thread of the book consists of Henry’s hospital experience where he chronicles the time that makes up the rest of the book - the events, we find, that have led him there - and generally hallucinates (maybe hallucinates) a set of characters who parallel others in the other story. It’s not as confusing as I make it sound, not, that is, if you don’t try too hard to make sense of it.
I don’t believe Hunt ever used the word exquisite in the text, but the title is a well earned compliment as the book is indeed “ingeniously devised” as the name suggests and Hunts writing fits the bill as well. I was struck - this is a small but telling thing - by his use of the word “truffle” as a verb at the end of the book in the acknowledgment section (which section, by the way, holds a key to the story that is alluded to about half-way through, but cryptically). By all accounts truffle is a noun - suggesting to me Hunt’s joie des mots and playfulness with language. It’s clear that Hunt likes to explore the various meanings a word can take on, just like the names people take or the way they change themselves with or without their clothes or tattoos etched into their skin. This manifests itself in words like the aforementioned “Job” or “swell” or “fleck” that he uses repeatedly, or the way he channels meaning with things like fish (as a friend, a food, a subject of a dream and a symbol) and cigars - Kindt smokes Dutch Masters (think Rembrandt).
Any complaints I have are trifling compared to the overall experience here, but Hunt seems to have had a few set-pieces on New York City in his head that felt slightly out of place as I read, and there is a seemingly obligatory or compulsive placement of a 9/11 placemark that seemed to me to have little purpose. Ultimately though, &lt;em&gt;The Exquisite&lt;/em&gt; is full of deliciously bad characters (Aunt Lulu, who might have been a cat murderer, is a particular favorite) rich allusions and an uncertain reality that, if you’re comfortable with that sort of thing, is a lot of fun.

   <title>Update on New York City Independent Bookstores</title>
   <link href="/article/2006/01/06/update-on-new-york-city-independent-bookstores/"/>
   <updated>2006-01-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2006/01/06/update-on-new-york-city-independent-bookstores</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
[UPDATE: Unfortunately, I&#39;m told that Lenox Hill Books is closing its doors]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I roam around New York City I mark areas by their restaurants and bookstores and thats how I think of them. It&#39;s amazing that while B&amp;#038;N and Amazon seem to dominate the landscape we have so many great independent bookstores. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re thriving, but while some have closed others have opened.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s been a while since I looked at my list of New York City independent bookstores and that exercise is long overdue. Today I updated McNally Robinson, which I put back in the 4th spot, tied in my view with St. Marks. I&#39;ll be revisiting some of my commentary here and adding Brooklyn stores too, some of which I&#39;ve grown fond of in my short time in the Borough of Kings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See also the comments section of a post at &lt;a href=&quot;http://metaxucafe.com/cafe/content/article/call_to_members_post_your_favorite_bookstore/&quot;&gt;MetaxuCafe&lt;/a&gt; for some other great bookstores.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lastly, note that the Colson Whitehead, Edmund White, Joyce Johnson, Sharon Olds and others from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bookcritics.org/page2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Book Critics Circle&lt;/a&gt; will announce finalists for their 2006 NBCC awards at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcnallyrobinsonnyc.com/events.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;McNally Robinson&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, January 14th at 7pm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This list is in order of personal preference. For more information on limitations to the selection, see below.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joycesociety.org/fw_frame.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Gotham Book Mart&quot;&gt;Gotham Book Mart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;16 East 46th Street (btwn 5th/Madison)
&lt;br /&gt;212 719-4448
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Simply the best bookstore in the city. Personal service, a rich history and a deep collection of serious literature. Both new and used books, including classics, poetry (probably the best in the city), many author-specific collections. The ultimate in browsing, even if the location is too midtowney to suggest from the outside that it has character. Gotham used to be the only place you needed to go to find literary journals. Since their recent move one block away - but seemingly a million miles from their old location - their journal collection has thinned. Hopefully that will change as they get settled in. See my previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/08/wise_men_have_f.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;article on Gotham Book Mart&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on Gotham for more information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://threelives.com/&quot;&gt;Three Lives &amp;#038; Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;154 West 10th Street (at Waverly Place)
&lt;br /&gt;212-741-2069
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Named in part for a Gertrude Stein book, Three Lives is a bookstore&#39;s bookstore. It really is a perfectly beautiful store. The owner has excellent taste and you can always find something interesting and new from some small presses as well as the majors. There are no used books here, so don&#39;t go looking for any bargains. Most but not all of the books at Three Lives are trade paperbacks. The poetry section is smallish, but there is a travel section, a New York section, staff picks and a selection of books on writing. The store hosts readings by popular authors, information about which you can find on their web-site. (p.s. Don&#39;t go to Three Lives without stopping by Joe, The Art of Coffee, for a near perfect ristretto espresso. Joe is around the block at the corner of Waverly and Gay.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mercer Street Books&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;206 Mercer St. (at Bleeker)
&lt;br /&gt;212 505-8615
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is one of my favorite used bookstores. They have a solid selection of fiction in hard and paper-back, literary criticism, classics and poetry. It&#39;s proximity to New York University is probably responsible for its good selection of criticism and other serious stuff; be sure to check out the recent arrivals table. They also have a selection of old literary journals, which are fun (if such things fit your idea of fun) to pick through randomly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcnallyrobinsonnyc.com/&quot;&gt;McNally Robinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;50 Prince St. (between Lafayette and Mulberry)
&lt;br /&gt;(212)274-1160
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
McNally Robinson is related to but independent of the Canadian company of the same name. It&#39;s great to see new bookstores opening and McNally Robinson appeared just last December in neighborhood nowadays called Nolita. They have pretty a active event calendar and a &amp;#8220;tea house.&amp;#8221; They have a small selection of literary journals, and a decent emphasis on good literature for a general bookstore. In fact, they have a &amp;#8220;local poets&amp;#8221; section set aside (of course this is New York City, so that could, practically speaking, be quite large, but it isn&#39;t. They also arrange their fiction into regions, which is unique and welcome. The selection is not huge, but appears to be thoughtful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Update: I had previously reported that McNally Robinson had shrunk their literary selection, but after speaking to the folks there, I am assured that the space has grown, so I&#39;ve retracted my earlier comment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From Mcnally Robinson&#39;s buyer: &amp;#8220;...the shelf space devoted to Lit has only grown since we opened...Literature happens to be squeezed into a physically tighter area in the more valuable upstairs real estate, but there are more books on the shelf than before. Initially I didn&#39;t believe it either.  Then I got a tape measure out. Interesting how we humans perceive space.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stmarksbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp&quot;&gt;St. Marks Bookshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;31 Third Ave. (at E. 9th)
&lt;br /&gt;212 260-7853
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fairly mainstream bookstore, but St. Marks does have a good selection of literature/culture and art books that to some degree reflect the neighborhood. Probably the second best place, behind Gotham, for literary journals. The poetry and fiction sections are by no means comprehensive, but well chosen. There are no used books here. (p.s. If you go to St. Marks, you must stop by the Mud truck at the Astor Place subway for one of the best cups of coffee in the city.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.housingworks.org/usedbookcafe/index.html&quot;&gt;Housing Works Used Book Cafe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;126 Crosby Street (at Houston)
&lt;br /&gt;212 334-3324
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The UBC is a great store for browsing and finding bargains. You can find a book and relax in the cafe. The environment is warm, the building is classic and there&#39;s a pretty wide selection of literature, always very cheap. Also, your money is well spent here, because 100% of the profits go to Housing Works, a non-profit organization that provides housing, healthcare, job training, advocacy and many other services for homeless New Yorkers living with HIV and Aids. That alone is worth doing some shopping there. They are having a sale this weekend (Jan 8/9) too, when everything is 30% off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strandbooks.com/home/&quot;&gt;The Strand Annex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;95 Fulton Street (3 blocks east of Broadway)
&lt;br /&gt;212 732-6070
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Annex is much better for browsing than its parent. A fairly deep used fiction selection (a lot of hardbacks) and much more space between the shelves to maneuver (the main Strand store can get very cramped and crowded).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://labyrinthbooks.com/StoreFrame.htm&quot;&gt;Labyrinth Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;536 West 112th Street (btwn. Brdwy/Amsterdam Ave.)
&lt;br /&gt;212 865-1588
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Described as a store of scholarly, literary &amp;#038; cultural books, Labyrinth serves the Columbia U. smarties. This bookstore has an amazing literature collection, including poetry, but major authors only. You will sometimes find what you are looking for discounted 25%, but don&#39;t count on it. The real bargains are at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.labyrinthbooks.com//main.asp?&quot;&gt;sale annex&lt;/a&gt;, which is only on-line, but where the prices tend to hover around $5-6. Some of the books from the annex, however, do find their way to Labyrinth&#39;s staircase even though that inventory doesn&#39;t seem to change much.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strandbooks.com/home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Strand&quot;&gt;The Strand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;828 Broadway (at 12th St.)
&lt;br /&gt;212 473-1452
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
18 Miles of Books. Overated, but probably the best place to sell your used books. Great for browsing and with enough effort you may find some bargains, but there are tons of (only) slightly discounted books. The Strand does have one specialty that is unparalleled as far as I know and that is their reviewer&#39;s copy section, tucked away in the basement. These are all new and recently published books at 1/2 off of their original price. Don&#39;t expect to find anything hot there though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Strand also has a kiosk at 5th Ave and 60th for a quick fix on your way to Cipriani&#39;s for a $19 glass of scotch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12th St. Books&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;11 East 12th St.
&lt;br /&gt;212 645-4340
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A smallish all used bookstore with a mixture of hard and paper-backs and a variety of subjects. Never a first stop, but worth a drop by if you&#39;re at the Strand (which is close by).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.murderink.com/Search.bok?category=Signed+Firsts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Murder Ink&quot;&gt;Ivy Books/Murder Ink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2488 Broadway (btwn W. 92nd/W. 93rd)
&lt;br /&gt;212 362-8905
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Murder Ink claims to carry every mystery book in print and I think that speaks for itself. Next door, Ivy carries a mixture of new and used literature. It&#39;s a small, quaint, homey shop (I think it was in the Visa ad with Kevin Bacon) that is always worth a stop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Biography Bookshop&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;400 Bleecker St. (at 11th St)
&lt;br /&gt;212 807-8655
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The best thing about BB is its location on a picturesque street in the village and the sale table outside. It seems that I always find a bargain there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.192books.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;192 Books&quot;&gt;192 Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;192 Tenth Avenue (at 21st  St)
&lt;br /&gt;212 255.4022
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Okay, so the name is not too creative, but it&#39;s a pleasant stop with a small but well chosen selection of literature and non-fiction and an art space. There are bargains to be had on a small cart toward the front, but most of the inventory consists of new paperbacks. The bookstore serves at the pleasure of its owners who also own an art gallery nearby, choose the books and set up the impressive readings the store hosts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://turtlepoint.com/lenox/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Lenox Hill Bookstore&quot;&gt;Lenox Hill Bookstore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1018 Lexington Avenue (btwn. 72nd/73rd)
&lt;br /&gt;212 472-7170
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, so it&#39;s on the Upper East Side. It&#39;s still a nice bookstore. Very Pleasant with a selection of the latest editions in literature and general non-fiction. Pretty mainstream stuff for the most part, but they have started their own &amp;#8220;Chapbook Series&amp;#8221; publishing and a &amp;#8220;First Editions Club&amp;#8221; if that&#39;s your sort of thing. I consider myself a reader, not a collector, but I do like to see bookshop owners venturing out and doing interesting things.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are more Shake &amp;#038; Co. locations than I&#39;ve listed. The one on broadway tends to have somewhat subversive collection, but otherwise all of the stores are fairly mainstream. Some sell textbooks, most sell magazines, but light on the journals.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ah, another Upper East Sider. Whenever I brush off my passport to go to that side of town I try to stop by Crawford Doyle. It&#39;s small and sells mostly new paperbacks and general non-fiction, but they do have an interesting collection of rare books to look at. It&#39;s always fun for an occasional browse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;11 West 42nd St. (Btwn 5th/6th Ave across from Bryant Park)
&lt;br /&gt;212 803-5890
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Coliseum is overrated. They seem to be trying to be all things to all people. Now they have a cafe and a not terribly helpful staff. The selection is spotty (my impression is that it was better before they moved to their new location) and doesn&#39;t seem to be too serious anywhere. i.e. I never find myself saying...&amp;#8220;I&#39;m looking for X book, maybe I should stop at Coliseum first.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;212-983-1111
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Posman used to be a good bookstore. They used to be right next to NYU and carried textbooks and an interesting selection of some serious stuff that you might not find elsewhere. Now they are very general, they sell a lot of paperbacks and serve GCT commuters, not book lovers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.churchill-books.com/&quot;&gt;Chartwells Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;55 East 52nd St. (In the arcade of the Park Avenue Plaza building between Park &amp;#038; Madison Avenues)
&lt;br /&gt;212 308-0643
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This store is dedicated to books by and about Winston Churchill. Much of their inventory is on-line, but the smallish store is pleasant and quiet with a small collection of literature and things like military books or foreign affairs, mostly in hardbound.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Westsider Used &amp;#038; Rare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2246 Broadway (at 80th)
&lt;br /&gt;212 362-0706
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are quite a few opportunities to buy used books around the Upper West Side. There are a lot of books being sold on tables on the street and there are little bookstores tucked away where you wouldn&#39;t know they are there, such as Gryphon Bookshop. One of them (the name escapes me) finally gave up and closed its dusty doors, but there are still others fighting the good fight. Westsider is one of them. Books stacked to its very tall ceiling (it has a loft, so the main floor is two stories), it&#39;s a fun place to pop into once in a while. As with most used bookstores, you never know what you will find. Unfortunately, the fiction section seems to be all paperbacks, which are not appealing to me because they&#39;ve already used a good part of their limited life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Biases:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This list is not meant to be a comprehensive list of stores. Here are my biases:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, these are only Manhattan shops, where, for the moment, I hang my hat and therefore buy my books. There are great bookstores that I know about in Brooklyn and upstate New York and the Berkshires, but then things start to get out of hand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This list is mostly concerned with literature and not special interests. In NYC there are bookstores that sell nothing but cookbooks, there are gay bookstores like the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore, there are travel bookstores, like the Complete Traveller (with an amazing used and rare travel book collection), stores that specialize in rare collectible books like Bauman&#39;s or Argosy, children&#39;s bookstores like Books of Wonder, art bookstores, and so on. Again, things would get out of hand if I were to try and write about all of them, and literature is my only interest in terms of the pastime of browsing for and buying books. I&#39;ve also only listed independent stores here because no one needs me to tell them about Barnes &amp;#038; Noble (although they do have a good annex on 18th st, their original store I think, where they have text books and such).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My last bias is that I really really like to find cheap used hardcover books; they last longer and tend not to have reader annotations (which I avidly add myself). I buy fiction, criticism and poetry. These stores are the places I go to find those things. If you know of a place worth checking out, I&#39;d love to hear about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Read widely, think well, and write often&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Life in CIA, by Harry Mathews</title>

   <updated>2005-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2005/12/15/my-life-in-cia-by-harry-mathews</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=1564783928%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/1564783928%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1564783928.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:5px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Around his early 40s a man looks at his life, searches, and more often than not he finds his youth has gone missing. If he has the means he buys a sports car or a boat, or if he&#39;s Harry Mathews he becomes a spy for CIA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, not really a spy; he pretended. He pretended to be a spy because circumstances opened themselves to it and he was an adventurous, creative guy who also happened to be a little bored.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The setting for My Life in CIA (those in the know don&#39;t use &amp;#8220;the&amp;#8221; in front of CIA, we learn) is Paris, France over the course of 1973. Harry Mathews is a divorced, well-to-do 43 year old man of the 70s - &amp;#8220;snug black velvet bellbottoms&amp;#8221; and all  - whose cocktail party friends suspect as being a spy. Every denial becomes a confirmation in their eyes so he decides to indulge and ride the intrigue for whatever mischievous fun he can find. Here&#39;s an example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8220;The following Monday I started passing the Saint Germain &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; going in. I carried a briefcase and walked briskly west down Boulevard Saint-Germain. On the corner of Rue Saint-Simon I stopped in the recessed doorway of a bookstore and looked back. No sign of my mark, not the first morning or the next; the third he was there. I led him by a devious route - Rues de Bellechasse, Varenne, Bourgogne, Las-Cases - to the church of Sainte Clothilde. I walked slowly and expectantly round the little park in front of the church. Then I hurried home a quite different way. I made sure I never lost my tail.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That afternoon I took the metro to Saint Augustin on the right bank. I got straight into a taxi that deposited me, back on the other side of town, near an Avis garage in the fifteenth arrondissement. I rented their cheapest model, a Peugeot 204. For half an hour I had fun practicing &amp;#8221;evasive driving techniques&amp;#8220; before heading for Sainte Clothilde. I pulled into the first space that opened up on the park side of Rue Marignan. Before leaving I cracked the rear window next to the sidewalk, left the same door unlocked, and pasted a two-inch strip of Scotch tape over its lower edge.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most I think, might be unnerved and stop the game after being followed by a stranger, but of course most people probably wouldn&#39;t pretend to be a spy. If a little Sunday cloak and dagger were not enough, Mathews goes so far as to create a company to act as cover and go out in the world laying a trail of open questions for the &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; spies to find. And find him they do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the tall tale grows, Matthews meets a cast of mysterious strangers - the tantric lover, Marie-Claude Quintelpreux - &amp;#8220;...release the demons in you that molest pure yearning!&amp;#8221; Or, Florence, who is forty inches tall and &amp;#8220;perfect in every limb,&amp;#8221; who saves Mathew&#39;s life in the obligatory foot-sex-with-a-midget-in-a-church-after-being-hosted-to-drinks-and-dancing-with-Zendor-an evildoer-whose-house-you-find-yourself-in-after-being-whisked-away-naked-in-an-exotic-rug scene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are also some true spies, opportunists, ruffians, beautiful women, communists and assassins who either don&#39;t know what to make of our hero, want something they think he&#39;s got, or want him out of the way; permanently. Through his odd encounters, we glimpse along with Mathews a world beyond the cocktail party chatter and intellectual ideas where he came from into a world of concrete action and cause-and-effect - as in, these people mean business. Mathews finds himself not so much deeply involved in the game of spying as in the brutality of staying alive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As enjoyable as the Mathews&#39; story is, I think that it also illuminates elements of the absurd character that geopolitics can take on, and how we all, playing our small roles, are taken in by it, sometimes forgetting that the consequences are often harsh. Mathews also captures a nervousness among some of his elite friends and others he encounters that might be as good as any snapshot of 1973. In one scene, Mathews speaks to a group of communists about his made-up geopolitical views but all they care to hear about is Watergate, a subject about which they seem hopelessly naive. It is not until he meets people in the country - far removed from the social and political scene - that the frenetic life he (momentarily) left behind can be seen for what it is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I read My Life in CIA one afternoon over the summer. Fitting for the season, I&#39;d say, because it&#39;s fast paced, fun and something of a farce. If you&#39;re one of those habitual daydreamers like me, you&#39;ll enjoy Mathews&#39; winking Graham Greenesque account of playing spy and even if you&#39;re not, you&#39;ll enjoy his crafty story telling and the occasional reference to velvet clothes and a few other &#39;70s artifacts.
&lt;/p&gt;

I&#39;ve updated my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2005/04/new_york_city_i.html&quot;&gt;New York City Independent Bookstore Guide&lt;/a&gt; to reflect (possibly not good) changes at McNally Robinson Bookstore. I knocked them down a couple of notches because it looks like they&#39;ve thinned out their literature (and maybe even poetry) section in favor of more non-fiction.

   <title>Jane {a murder}, by Maggie Nelson</title>
   <link href="/article/2005/07/14/jane-a-murder-by-maggie-nelson/"/>
   <updated>2005-07-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2005/07/14/jane-a-murder-by-maggie-nelson</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I almost didn&#39;t pick up Maggie Nelson&#39;s book &lt;em&gt;Jane {a murder}&lt;/em&gt;. The title and the photo on the cover said to me &amp;#8220;this is not a book for you.&amp;#8221; Looking at the back cover, phrases like &amp;#8220;dark, female masterpiece,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;true story of a murder&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;blurred-genre memoir&amp;#8221; all confirmed that this was a book to put on the bottom of the burgeoning stack. Somewhere inside of me though, I like to think there exists a sixth sense, a nagging intuition about good books that made me pick up &lt;em&gt;Jane&lt;/em&gt; just to read a page or two. I didn&#39;t put it down again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Jane {a murder}&lt;/em&gt; is a classified as a book of poetry and a book of true crime. It is all things described, but none of those capture its singular purpose and its classification doesn&#39;t matter when you read it. It&#39;s a story well told of a woman brutally killed and another woman yearning to know more about the ever present shade of her murdered aunt. Jane was murdered in 1969 while a student at the University of Michigan. Four years later, Jane&#39;s sister had a daughter who knew about her aunt, but never quite enough and certainly never about the night she was shot, which was just one in a series of media-sensationalized killings dubbed the &amp;#8220;Michigan Murders.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As an antidote to that sensationalism, Nelson explores Jane&#39;s life and death with a poet&#39;s sensibility through anecdotes, clippings and diary entries. Her skill as a poet is matched by the way she weaves these various elements together as a deft storyteller. In fact, the diary entries, which were written years before her murder are not all in chronological order, but seamlessly placed in the order, perhaps, of Maggie Nelson&#39;s emotional discovery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These two passages sit on facing pages. The first is Jane&#39;s diary entry from 1966, around the age of twenty, three years before her death:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Careless dribble - again
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Strange, lying in bed
&lt;br /&gt;unable to sleep
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s all familiar
&lt;br /&gt;but the thoughts inside of me
&lt;br /&gt;are not
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Questions, over and over
&lt;br /&gt;home too long, back too soon
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;alone, really alone
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;What are you like when you&#39;re alone
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;ugly, heavy, disreputable
&lt;br /&gt;unsure, awake, useless
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This room is hideous
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next page, titled &amp;#8220;Hideous&amp;#8221;, comes after Ms. Nelson has maybe come to know too much about Jane&#39;s murder:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Unable to sleep, surrounded by
&lt;br /&gt;her words. Afraid, truly afraid
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;to tell you about my brain
&lt;br /&gt;chattering with cruelties-
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;When did she know
&lt;br /&gt;she was in danger;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;the terrible little gun
&lt;br /&gt;flat against her head;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;which shot first,
&lt;br /&gt;the front or the back?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The fear,
&lt;br /&gt;her fear
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;but I cannot imagine that.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why keep trying?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I can hear you say. Well
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t help it. I just do. Then
&lt;br /&gt;to stop the thoughts, I imagine
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;two quick, dull shots
&lt;br /&gt;that come as a sort of relief. Don&#39;t you know,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I recognize this
&lt;br /&gt;as hell.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I try to use the tricks I&#39;ve learned to get through this-
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meditate on a wrathful deity.
&lt;br /&gt;Watch it melt into light.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And so I do, and find
&lt;br /&gt;that not even Kali
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;with her mouth full of blood
&lt;br /&gt;non Thor with his hammer
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;can take me away from here, where
&lt;br /&gt;your breath spouts out of you
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;and I listen.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ms. Nelson took some license with Jane&#39;s diary entries, at the least creating line-breaks, but she uses them to such great affect that they become Jane&#39;s cries. What under normal circumstances are fairly typical reflections on youthful angst and self-doubt - &amp;#8220;right now I hate my sister so...I am jealous of Barb&#39;s fun, dates, looks, assurance...&amp;#8221; - become here the private truths of a woman denied her life before she had a chance to work them out - &amp;#8220;This kid doesn&#39;t know anything. / She&#39;d like to sleep the childish slumber of a baby and yet live in a world of complexities.&amp;#8221; -  through them we come closer to understanding her tragedy, not so much through pathos but empathy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What makes the difference between pathos and empathy is restraint. That is a strength in this book. Halfway through we are led to the murder scene, the press and investigation, meditations on blood -  &amp;#8220;Can anyone like blood the way one likes the mountain or the sea&amp;#8221; - the freaks that call Jane&#39;s grieving parents - &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Where&#39;s Jane, boo-hoo-hoo&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; - and other detritus left in the wake of a brutal murder, like the psychic brought in to solve the case of the serial killer - &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Her face was beat, beat, beat. It was wrinkled like a monkey&#39;s&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; But before she takes us too far down the path of &amp;#8220;true-crime,&amp;#8221; just when we start to feel like voyeurs getting too close, Nelson puts down the looking-glass and stops to breath - &amp;#8220;Somehow I need to make it clear: none of these details belongs to me.&amp;#8221; By then though, like stumbling across a dead body, we can&#39;t forget what we&#39;ve seen - &amp;#8220;the imaginary is what tends / to become real, and when it does / there&#39;s no paint black enough / to cover it up.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the beginning of the book, Nelson imagines the final moments of Jane&#39;s life:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
She had been shot once in the front and once in the back of the head. She wandered, trying to find someone to remove the slugs from her skull. She was not dead yet, but she feared she was dying.The holes in her head were perfectly round and bloodless, with burnt-flared edges, two eclipses. The passage of air through the holes felt peculiar, just dimly painful, like chewing hot or cold food on a cavity, the sensation of space where it had once been dense and full.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Sunlight shot around the circumference of each black rind, so that a long shaft of pale light cast out from the center of her forehead, and another shaft streamed behind her.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this the light of the mind? Is this the light of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; mind?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This would be an easy passage to overdo, but I think it&#39;s great. It tells us right in the beginning that the author has put herself as nearly as she can imagine into the shoes of Jane. And although Jane&#39;s parents don&#39;t figure prominently in the book, this piece, where she says &amp;#8220;the sensation of space where it had once been dense and full&amp;#8221; signifies their loss, the void where there was once a life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Jane&lt;/em&gt; works so well because the poetry itself is nearly invisible. So much contemporary poetry tends to be too self-conscious to let its meaning work on you, but Maggie Nelson&#39;s poems manage to both fluidly pull us through the story and stand alone  - they are purposeful and poignant with no pretense. Indeed, I would classify &lt;em&gt;Jane {a murder}&lt;/em&gt; as a page-turner.
&lt;/p&gt;

Ernest Hemingway said &amp;#8220;All good books have one thing in common - they are truer than if they had really happened, and after you have read one of them you will feel that all that happened, happened to you and then it belongs to you forever.&amp;#8221;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think Pappa stole that idea from Cervantes. Who better knew how literature seeps into our consciousness just as much as we let it? Who more than Don Quixote lived through the books he read, defended the honor of made up characters and, when becoming one of those characters himself championed the unseen author of his own history?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I wrote a piece called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.400windmills.com/2005/04/why_read_don_qu.html&quot;&gt;Why Read Don Quixote?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; just before starting the book, I wondered if I would finish, or enjoy it or if in the end it would mean anything to me. I admitted then that I had started once and put it down. I said too in that piece that reading the &lt;em&gt;Quixote&lt;/em&gt; was the result &amp;#8220;of a seemingly inevitable collision with the book through others I&amp;#8217;ve read.&amp;#8221; I had no idea that &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/em&gt; is, in many ways, all about that collision. Our ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha was a great lover of books. Not only did he read a lot, his erudition amazed everyone he met, even as they puzzled over his madness. He retained so much that his books became collectively his Bible in the way that many look to theirs as a manual on how to live. But for Quixote, the &lt;em&gt;Gospel according to John&lt;/em&gt; was instead maybe the Gospel according to Amad&amp;#237;s of Gaul.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like the parting of the Red Sea, Don Quixote&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;history&amp;#8221; was born from the very idea that the romances he read were indeed &amp;#8220;truer than if they had really happened.&amp;#8221; That trueness, Don Quixote&amp;#8217;s reality, is the most fascinating element of the story. His sanity always lay just below the surface in the same but opposite way that most of us have a little madness just below our social veneer.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was struck around mid-way through when a boy whom Don Quixote had &amp;#8220;saved&amp;#8221; from a beating by his master, revealed that because of Don Quixote&amp;#8217;s actions he was beaten even more. Quixote&amp;#8217;s remorse was painful and I felt as though he would have passed through his sanity divide and stayed there, but ultimately he couldn&amp;#8217;t help himself and continued on his travels. That sort of thing was a constant source of frustration and tension throughout the book. He never seemed to learn from all that happened until finally he was vanquished himself, which wasn&amp;#8217;t just a matter of valor, but faith. When Don Quixote stopped believing in the literature, he stopped believing in himself and he died.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right from the prologue we know that the book &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/em&gt; is about language and literature as Cervantes criticizes the methods of his peers and forebears. There are stories within the story and most every character at some point becomes someone who they are not in everyday life - everyone is a storyteller and everyone straddles the line of believing in their tales.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of language, Sancho is constantly harangued by Don Quixote for his poor use of proverbs and incessant malapropisms. Interestingly, Quixote&amp;#8217;s intolerance for poor language and circumlocution is usually met by the public&amp;#8217;s vulgar tastes. For example, the Duke and Duchess love Sancho&amp;#8217;s witless witticisms and always insist he keep talking despite Quixote&amp;#8217;s protests. So while Quixote chastises Sancho, everyone else is amused and only wants to hear more, which seems to be the very same problem that Cervantes has in stamping out the romance literature of old.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our text, putting aside for a moment that it is a translation from the Spanish, is, we are told, a translation from events that transpired in Spanish dialogue into Arabic by Cide Hamete Benengeli, which is then translated back to Spanish for the benefit of our narrator. This naturally was an area of exploration for speakers on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.400windmills.com/2005/04/pen_world_voice.html&quot;&gt;Global Quixote translator&amp;#8217;s panel&lt;/a&gt;. There are a lot of errors in the book and no one knows if they were intentional or not, although some suspect they were, and that becomes just one aspect of the translation. Additionally, most agree that Cervantes&amp;#8217; wordplay is often central to enjoying the book and extracting meaning from the dialogue. I recommend Edith Grossman&amp;#8217;s translation to anyone who thinks those elements are essential. I thought Grossman&amp;#8217;s spare footnotes terrifically enlightened me when Cervantes used meanings that through time or translation would be lost. I imagine there are many more examples that a scholarly edition would include, but her judgement produced a balanced, readable and enjoyable novel. Given the layers of translation, a non-Spanish reader must recognize their translator as just as much a part of the book as Hamete or Cervantes himself.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now that &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/em&gt; has sat snugly on the shelf for a couple of weeks, I&amp;#8217;ve practically forgotten some of my earlier misgivings (that I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.400windmills.com/2005/04/the_knight_of_t.html&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt;). I see now why this novel is loved by so many great writers and I think the Hemingway quote says it all. I like to think, like Don Quixote or like Fabrizio in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0679783180%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0679783180%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot; id=&quot;2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0679783180%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot;&gt;The Charterhouse of Parma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - who was impelled to set out into the world by reading about Napoleon - that I too live richer having seen the world through the lives of my imaginary heros. &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/em&gt; is a testament to reading and a testament to believing in the imagination, even if the outside world doesn&amp;#8217;t always get it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I remember the novel &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0446673382%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0446673382%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot; id=&quot;2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0446673382%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot;&gt;A Mapmaker&amp;#8217;s Dream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, where a hermetic cartographer draws maps of the world based solely upon the exotic tales of travelers. Fra Mauro, the mapmaker, says:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
...I believed that the thoughts and impressions of all my visitors were derived from a certain actuality, at all times palpable, when in truth their remarks had quite obviously passed through the filter of their own sensibility.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;What that belief really means is that my map is a distortion. All its representation of terrain and oceans is but the revelation of how I regarded my visitors&amp;#8217; perceptions in the first place. I now realize that the world is not real save in the way each of us impresses upon it his own sensibility. More importantly, this sensibility results from a belief in the world being a measurable whole, rather than something that extends beyond time or place.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Yet I am grateful to those who have provided me with the benefit of their illusions. They have journeyed to Venice, to this monastery, from so many distant places in order to share with me the purest of all deceptions - that of their own willingness to be entranced.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a way, we all have that, we are all a little crazy because we are willing to be entranced, and so was most every character in Don Quixote. I think that one thing that people miss when talking about this book is just how great every single character is. Besides maybe &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;, I can&amp;#8217;t think of another book that makes every single character integral to the story. It&amp;#8217;s that wholeness that gives it life and makes it so true.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For anyone who has only read the first part of Don Quixote, I say read the second. In some way that I can&amp;#8217;t identify, particularly since they were published ten years apart, the second half completes and defines the novel as a whole and makes it so much more meaningful. &lt;em&gt;Vale&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
**SPOILERS ALERT (I&amp;#8217;ll try not to reveal much, but there may be spoilers here)**
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I close in with less than a quarter of the book remaining, I thought it worthwhile to collect randomly a few observations I&amp;#8217;ve had on the second half - or third sally - of Don Quixote&amp;#8217;s journey. Book two feels radically different than book one as the reception Our Ingenious Gentleman and his squire receive is far more peaceful than before. There is less violence and what little there is has tended to favor Quixote rather than harm him (for example the joust with the Knight of the Mirrors). The Knight of the Mirrors is an apt name, I think, because in part two there are many people disguising themselves in one way or another, such as the Knight of the Mirrors himself; Pedro who has reappeared from book one; Basilio&amp;#8217;s death, which is the third mock suicide by blade for the sake of a love in the book as a whole, with the others being Luscinda and Camila; there is the enchanted Dulcinea, although she is only disguised by Sancho&amp;#8217;s guile; and lastly, the Duke and Duchess, who are only in disguise in so far as their sincerity is concerned.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sancho Panza is becoming something of a caricature of himself in book two - his subtle observations from part one have given way to strings of barely relevant proverbs and self-serving proclamations. I had long thought that the quote &amp;#8220;there are but two families in this world, the haves and the have-nots&amp;#8221; was attributed to Don Quixote, but on page 594 I found that line streaming from Sancho&amp;#8217;s mouth as he reverses his loyalty to someone because they are rich and therefore have food for him:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And he showed him the pot full of geese and chickens, and seizing one of them, he began to eat with great verve and enthusiasm, saying:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;To hell with Basilio&amp;#8217;s talents! You&amp;#8217;re worth what you have, and what you have is what you&amp;#8217;re worth. There are only two lineages in the world, as my grandmother used to say, and that&amp;#8217;s the haves and the have-nots, though she was on the side of having; nowadays, Se&amp;#241;or Don Quixote, wealth is better than wisdom: an ass covered in gold seems better than a saddled horse. And so I say again that I&amp;#8217;m on the side of Camacho, whose pots are overflowing with geese and chickens, hares and rabbits, while Basilio&amp;#8217;s, if they ever show up, and even if they don&amp;#8217;t, won&amp;#8217;t hold anything but watered wine.&amp;#8221;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sancho&amp;#8217;s boldness has grown with his skepticism, which instead of showing any sense of perspicacity instead has made him seem more simpleminded. It&amp;#8217;s confusing in a way, as both Sancho and Don Quixote have an awareness of Quixote&amp;#8217;s madness and what is looking more and more like Sancho&amp;#8217;s madness, but they refuse to accept any one else&amp;#8217;s recognition of it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The emphasis on language is also interesting here and more prominant in book two. Sancho&amp;#8217;s bold pronouncements are usually countered by his malaprops. Malapropism is a term used to describe a person&amp;#8217;s use of a (typically polysyllabic) word incorrectly, primarily with the effect of contradicting themselves or making them look foolish or comical. The word was coined from Mrs. Malaprop in an 18th century play called &lt;em&gt;The Rivals&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Brinsley Sheridan. My handy dictionary of literary terms credits Shakespeare as using them (not called malaprops) in &lt;em&gt;Much Ado About Nothing&lt;/em&gt;, but I would say that Sancho&amp;#8217;s malaprops are a prime example too.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
James Wood in his essay on Don Quixote in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0374177376%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0374177376%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot; class=&quot;floatimgleft&quot; id=&quot;2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0374177376%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot;&gt;The Irresponsible Self&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, says that &amp;#8220;A rough analogy of the action in the second book might go like this: Jesus Christ is wandering around first-century Palestine trying to convince people that he is the true Messiah.&amp;#8221; That seems to me as though (and Wood does address this in a more thoughtful way) the New Testament had been written before Christ&amp;#8217;s journey and he was only forming part two. I bring this up mostly because of the religious aspects I&amp;#8217;ve noticed in part two. Of course, religion is a theme throughout the book because religious life and religious delineations were a significant part of life then and a part of the racial landscape. But I&amp;#8217;m thinking more of personal terms, where for example, Sancho performs a catechism of sorts on page 515. Quixote uses biblical language to describe his journey on page 495:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;I know that the path of virtue is very narrow and the road of wickedness is broad and spacious; I know that their endings and conclusions are different, because the expansive, spacious road of wickedness ends in death, and the road of virtue, so narrow and difficult, ends in life, not the life that ends, but life everlasting...&amp;#8221;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The quote above looks very much like this from Gospels of St. Matthew in the King James Bible:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
7:13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: 7:14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And that, interestingly, is followed by another line appropriate to many of the people that Don Quixote encounters:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
7:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep&amp;#8217;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But most significantly I think Quixote&amp;#8217;s experience in the Cave of Montesinos is very much like the experiences of Galahad and Lancelot in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0140442200%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0140442200%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot; class=&quot;floatimgleft&quot; id=&quot;2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0140442200%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot;&gt;The Quest for the Holy Grail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which I read in its &amp;#8220;original&amp;#8221; form before reading Don Quixote. I say original as opposed to, say, Sir Malory&amp;#8217;s version because this so-called original is much more an allegory for the quest for nearness to God than a tale of errant knights. Book two of Don Quixote is much closer to the religious aspect of the quest, where Quixote is a lancelot character, a searcher, rather than a Galahad character, who is much closer to pureness than even Quixote would give himself credit for.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Quixote&amp;#8217;s experience in the cave could be taken straight from the &lt;em&gt;Quest&lt;/em&gt;, and Dulcinea&amp;#8217;s enchantment, as false as it is (another theme!), looks much more now like the Lady in the Lake from the Arthurian tales. None of that should come as any great surprise, but in my mind, it is the religious aspect of the quest that is most striking and I think from what I know of the ending of the book, that idea will bear out, but I&amp;#8217;ll have to wait and see.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Thank You for Not Reading: Essays on Literary Trivia, by Dubravka Ugresic</title>

   <id>/article/2005/05/13/thank-you-for-not-reading-essays-on-literary-trivia-by-dubravka-ugresic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/ugresic.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:18px&quot; alt=&quot;altimage&quot; /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Market and Ms. Ugresic&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Thank You for Not Reading: Essays on Literary Trivia&lt;/em&gt; by Dubravka Ugresic, Dalkey Archive Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have one of those friends, always ironic, quick with the comebacks and a wry opinion on just about everything. Dubravka Ugresic, one might surmise from reading her book of essays, is one of those people. The aptly named &lt;em&gt;Thank You for Not Reading: Essays on Literary Trivia&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of 31 short pieces &amp;#8211; smoothly translated from the Croation by Celia Hawkesworth&amp;#8212;ostensibly about the state of the publishing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say ostensibly because &lt;em&gt;Thank You for Not Reading&lt;/em&gt; is about much more than the publishing industry in all its celebrity chasing glory, it is a book with a unique perspective. Ugresic grew up in communist Yugoslavia, worked at the Institute for the Theory of Literature at the University of Zagreb, and left what is now Croatia in 1993. Today she lives in Amsterdam. Her point of view, always in sight here, is that of an intelligent woman&amp;#8212;a writer in a narrowly spoken language&amp;#8212;from a small country that has undergone ideological, political and calamitous change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&amp;#8217;s arc is from light to dark, never too dark, merely skimming the surface of a seriousness that by the end leaves the reader questioning Ugresic&amp;#8217;s intentions. We begin with Eeyore as our mascot and are treated to a description of Joan Collins at the annual London Book Fair &amp;quot;dressed like a quotation: in a little pink Chanel suit, with a pink pillbox hat on her head and a coquettish veil over her eyes.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What does this have to do with literature?&amp;quot; she asks. &amp;quot;Almost nothing,&amp;quot; she points out, and it is just this sort of trivia that has &amp;quot;swamped contemporary literary life and become, it seems, more important than the books.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The writer who does not accept the rules of the market will simply perish . . . The world of the literary market is ruled by the producers of books, but producing books does not quite mean the same thing as producing literature.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, the premise of Ugresic&amp;#8217;s book is settled and we are entertained with biting commentary on pitching literary agents, book blurbs, celebrity and pop culture, and The Market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;quot;market&amp;quot; can mean many things and it can be understood here as &amp;quot;the publishing industry,&amp;quot; but in my opinion, when Ugresic says market she does so with the mind of an Eastern European. I don&amp;#8217;t mean to imply that she longs for a return to communism, indeed, as an intellectual, she seems to be stuck in the middle of two ideologies that have in her lifetime shown their ugly faces. No, I think the word market to her connotes something more like Chichikov&amp;#8217;s trading of dead souls in Gogol&amp;#8217;s novel, with all its metaphorical double meaning. The market she speaks of is seemingly harmless, yet opportunistic and ultimately evil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is irony that Ugresic revels in. In the essay &amp;quot;Engineers of Human Souls&amp;quot; she compares literature, essentially in America and Russia: &amp;quot;The demands of the market have no ideology; they have been been cleansed of it, they are pure, desirable, wreathed in glamour and glory. What the market decides is confirmed by millions, and its moral dimension is not in question. The work is worth as much as we pay for it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says it. She knows it&amp;#8217;s true, but we know that she doesn&amp;#8217;t believe it. Similarly, she follows that passage with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former communist, noncommercial cultures, particularly in Stalin&amp;#8217;s days, must be given credit for the professionalism of the writer&amp;#8217;s craft&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I maintain that Stalinism was a stern school of literary professionalism. Stalinism made writers into professionals, who would surely be rampaging through the international literary market now, if only they&amp;#8217;d lived. Writers had to be professionals, it was a matter of life and death. Stalinist writers had to take great care to follow the rules of the game: the rules of socialist realism. Literature had to be comprehensible to the broad reading masses&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, Ugresic easily segues to contemporary commercial writers and mass producers of books, like Stephen King, that are &amp;quot;comprehensible to the broad reading masses.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugresic&amp;#8217;s strength is in making her point through anecdotal stories and putting context around her everyday observations. In &amp;quot;How I Coud Have Been Ivana Trump and Where I Went Wrong,&amp;quot; she chronicles the rise of her fellow Eastern European from small town Czech girl, national ski team member and model, to Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s wife, businesswoman and finally celebrity writer. When the two meet, Ugresic finds &amp;quot;her appearance somehow touching. With her exaggeratedly bleached hair, too-heavy make-up, and lips like fresh hot dogs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her point? &amp;quot; . . . when my students ask me how one becomes a writer, I reply with complete authority: &amp;#8216;Take up a sport and train like hell. Anything else could lead you in the wrong direction.&amp;#8217;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While she&amp;#8217;s good at inferring from the obvious, many of her earlier essays cover material that is too obvious or trite to even the most casual observer of the publishing world or pop culture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blurb is one of these devices, only apparently innocent. If words such as fantastic, astonishing&amp;#8230;and so on accompany the name of some well known person on the back of your own book, entrance to the world of references is almost guaranteed. And the well known person need not be a writer. Bill Gates and Madonna are more effective promoters than Gunter Grass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of pop icons scattered throughout the book, including Oprah, Monika Lewinsky, O.J., the apparent media-influenced families of the Columbine victims, and the &amp;quot;mega-death&amp;quot; of Lady Di. The juxtaposition of death, celebrity, and media occur often here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This obsession with the symbols of mass culture might be best explained in her essay &amp;quot;The Role of Kirk Douglas in My Life&amp;quot; where she describes growing up watching imported American movies and says &amp;quot;I believe that we outdid the film critics of the time in our knowledge of the names of Hollywood actors,&amp;quot; only to find out later that Kirk Douglas, who she had received a letter from as a young girl, had became an author:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was overcome by a sudden vague sadness&amp;#8230; And then the sadness became an inner protest. The protest came from the sudden sense of my historical moment; the thought that everyone in the world has become a writer, literature was not a mountain peak which I had been trying to climb for years driven by the romantic notion that it belonged only to the persistent and dedicated, and that it was therefore only literary mountain-climbers who earned the right to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we see this is a very personal book. Her contempt of popular culture rises from her own seriousness of craft and intellect contrasted with the easy ride to literary fame that the aura of celebrity has given to so many. The Hollywood images of her youth crashing with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier, lighter stories unfold into observations of an exiled writer: the suspect motivations of the writing and intellectual community in her home country, the corruption and malfeasance of her new so-called democratic government, and the sense of homelessness that even a self-willed exile feels. It is in this later part of the book that Ugresic really excels, by giving us a very real sense of her unique perspective. But it is here too that she fails, because we have been so long riddled with her cynicism, by now we don&amp;#8217;t know what is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many of her essays, Ugresic includes herself with those she damns, as if it&amp;#8217;s okay to snarl when doing it in the mirror. But that does not justify all of her conclusions. For example, Ugresic takes on (without naming names, necessarily) the writers and intellectuals she would be a part of. In &amp;quot;War is War, but Intellectuals Are Only Human,&amp;quot; she says that the &amp;quot;tragic disintegration of Yugoslavia was extensively covered by the media.&amp;quot; True. But then she says that &amp;quot;Miles of film and tons of paper were used up. Heaps of documentaries, films, books, photographs were produced, even souvenirs . . . &amp;quot; She is still correct, but she goes on, and in discussing intellectuals, filmmakers and journalists as one massive lump of media, in this situation seems more sarcastic than thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that she is determined to leave no area of public or literary life untouched, but you only need to think of two people positively involved in the Balkan conflict, Susan Sontag and Jean-Luc Godard, both representing the opposite of everything Ms. Ugresic condemns, to see how thin a shield cynicism can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not to say that she gets the media&amp;#8217;s hold on culture wrong. In one of her best wry watercooler moments, she quotes a proponent of a &amp;quot;Turn off Your TV Month&amp;quot; as saying &amp;quot;Who knows whether our campaign will have the same significance this time as it had last year, when we had fantastic media coverage.&amp;quot; To her credit, she takes a wide swath of heavy topics such as globalization, war, culture, and a market driven publishing industry and treats them with enough levity to make the book entertaining. But it sometimes feels like a barrier, the way we tell jokes at a funeral when what we really want to do is scream our bloody heads off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end, Ugresic returns again to her original theme: &amp;quot;In the global market we are all sellers, even when it does not seem that way. Everyone automatically holds out his business card, everyone strives to be heard even when he has nothing to say&amp;#8230; The only acceptable aesthetic choice that remains for people of good taste is silence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
UPDATED (changed info on McNally Robinson)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This list is in order of personal preference. For more information on limitations to the selection, see below.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joycesociety.org/fw_frame.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Gotham Book Mart&quot;&gt;Gotham Book Mart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;16 East 46th Street (btwn 5th/Madison)
&lt;br /&gt;212 719-4448
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Simply the best bookstore in the city. Personal service, a rich history and a deep collection of serious literature. Both new and used books, including classics, poetry (probably the best in the city), many author-specific collections. The ultimate in browsing, even if the location is too midtowney to suggest from the outside that it has character. Gotham used to be the only place you needed to go to find literary journals. Since their recent move one block away - but seemingly a million miles from their old location - their journal collection has thinned. Hopefully that will change as they get settled in. See my previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/08/wise_men_have_f.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;article on Gotham Book Mart&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on Gotham for more information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://threelives.com/&quot;&gt;Three Lives &amp;#038; Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;154 West 10th Street (at Waverly Place)
&lt;br /&gt;212-741-2069
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Named in part for a Gertrude Stein book, Three Lives is a bookstore&#39;s bookstore. It really is a perfectly beautiful store. The owner has excellent taste and you can always find something interesting and new from some small presses as well as the majors. There are no used books here, so don&#39;t go looking for any bargains. Most but not all of the books at Three Lives are trade paperbacks. The poetry section is smallish, but there is a travel section, a New York section, staff picks and a selection of books on writing. The store hosts readings by popular authors, information about which you can find on their web-site. (p.s. Don&#39;t go to Three Lives without stopping by Joe, The Art of Coffee, for a near perfect ristretto espresso. Joe is around the block at the corner of Waverly and Gay.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mercer Street Books&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;206 Mercer St. (at Bleeker)
&lt;br /&gt;212 505-8615
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is one of my favorite used bookstores. They have a solid selection of fiction in hard and paper-back, literary criticism, classics and poetry. It&#39;s proximity to New York University is probably responsible for its good selection of criticism and other serious stuff; be sure to check out the recent arrivals table. They also have a selection of old literary journals, which are fun (if such things fit your idea of fun) to pick through randomly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcnallyrobinsonnyc.com/&quot;&gt;McNally Robinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;50 Prince St. (between Lafayette and Mulberry)
&lt;br /&gt;(212)274-1160
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
McNally Robinson is related to but independent of the Canadian company of the same name. It&#39;s great to see new bookstores opening and McNally Robinson appeared just last December in neighborhood nowadays called Nolita. They have pretty a active event calendar and a &amp;#8220;tea house.&amp;#8221; They have a small selection of literary journals, and a decent emphasis on good literature for a general bookstore. In fact, they have a &amp;#8220;local poets&amp;#8221; section set aside (of course this is New York City, so that could, practically speaking, be quite large, but it isn&#39;t. They also arrange their fiction into regions, which is unique and welcome. The selection is not huge, but appears to be thoughtful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Update: I had previously reported that McNally Robinson had shrunk their literary selection, but after speaking to the folks there, I am assured that the space has grown, so I&#39;ve retracted my earlier comment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From Mcnally Robinson&#39;s buyer: &amp;#8220;...the shelf space devoted to Lit has only grown since we opened...Literature happens to be squeezed into a physically tighter area in the more valuable upstairs real estate, but there are more books on the shelf than before. Initially I didn&#39;t believe it either.  Then I got a tape measure out. Interesting how we humans perceive space.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stmarksbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp&quot;&gt;St. Marks Bookshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;31 Third Ave. (at E. 9th)
&lt;br /&gt;212 260-7853
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fairly mainstream bookstore, but St. Marks does have a good selection of literature/culture and art books that to some degree reflect the neighborhood. Probably the second best place, behind Gotham, for literary journals. The poetry and fiction sections are by no means comprehensive, but well chosen. There are no used books here. (p.s. If you go to St. Marks, you must stop by the Mud truck at the Astor Place subway for one of the best cups of coffee in the city.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.housingworks.org/usedbookcafe/index.html&quot;&gt;Housing Works Used Book Cafe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;126 Crosby Street (at Houston)
&lt;br /&gt;212 334-3324
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The UBC is a great store for browsing and finding bargains. You can find a book and relax in the cafe. The environment is warm, the building is classic and there&#39;s a pretty wide selection of literature, always very cheap. Also, your money is well spent here, because 100% of the profits go to Housing Works, a non-profit organization that provides housing, healthcare, job training, advocacy and many other services for homeless New Yorkers living with HIV and Aids. That alone is worth doing some shopping there. They are having a sale this weekend (Jan 8/9) too, when everything is 30% off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strandbooks.com/home/&quot;&gt;The Strand Annex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;95 Fulton Street (3 blocks east of Broadway)
&lt;br /&gt;212 732-6070
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Annex is much better for browsing than its parent. A fairly deep used fiction selection (a lot of hardbacks) and much more space between the shelves to maneuver (the main Strand store can get very cramped and crowded).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://labyrinthbooks.com/StoreFrame.htm&quot;&gt;Labyrinth Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;536 West 112th Street (btwn. Brdwy/Amsterdam Ave.)
&lt;br /&gt;212 865-1588
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Described as a store of scholarly, literary &amp;#038; cultural books, Labyrinth serves the Columbia U. smarties. This bookstore has an amazing literature collection, including poetry, but major authors only. You will sometimes find what you are looking for discounted 25%, but don&#39;t count on it. The real bargains are at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.labyrinthbooks.com//main.asp?&quot;&gt;sale annex&lt;/a&gt;, which is only on-line, but where the prices tend to hover around $5-6. Some of the books from the annex, however, do find their way to Labyrinth&#39;s staircase even though that inventory doesn&#39;t seem to change much.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strandbooks.com/home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Strand&quot;&gt;The Strand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;828 Broadway (at 12th St.)
&lt;br /&gt;212 473-1452
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
18 Miles of Books. Overated, but probably the best place to sell your used books. Great for browsing and with enough effort you may find some bargains, but there are tons of (only) slightly discounted books. The Strand does have one specialty that is unparalleled as far as I know and that is their reviewer&#39;s copy section, tucked away in the basement. These are all new and recently published books at 1/2 off of their original price. Don&#39;t expect to find anything hot there though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Strand also has a kiosk at 5th Ave and 60th for a quick fix on your way to Cipriani&#39;s for a $19 glass of scotch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12th St. Books&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;11 East 12th St.
&lt;br /&gt;212 645-4340
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A smallish all used bookstore with a mixture of hard and paper-backs and a variety of subjects. Never a first stop, but worth a drop by if you&#39;re at the Strand (which is close by).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.murderink.com/Search.bok?category=Signed+Firsts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Murder Ink&quot;&gt;Ivy Books/Murder Ink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2488 Broadway (btwn W. 92nd/W. 93rd)
&lt;br /&gt;212 362-8905
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Murder Ink claims to carry every mystery book in print and I think that speaks for itself. Next door, Ivy carries a mixture of new and used literature. It&#39;s a small, quaint, homey shop (I think it was in the Visa ad with Kevin Bacon) that is always worth a stop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Biography Bookshop&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;400 Bleecker St. (at 11th St)
&lt;br /&gt;212 807-8655
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The best thing about BB is its location on a picturesque street in the village and the sale table outside. It seems that I always find a bargain there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.192books.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;192 Books&quot;&gt;192 Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;192 Tenth Avenue (at 21st  St)
&lt;br /&gt;212 255.4022
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Okay, so the name is not too creative, but it&#39;s a pleasant stop with a small but well chosen selection of literature and non-fiction and an art space. There are bargains to be had on a small cart toward the front, but most of the inventory consists of new paperbacks. The bookstore serves at the pleasure of its owners who also own an art gallery nearby, choose the books and set up the impressive readings the store hosts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://turtlepoint.com/lenox/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Lenox Hill Bookstore&quot;&gt;Lenox Hill Bookstore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1018 Lexington Avenue (btwn. 72nd/73rd)
&lt;br /&gt;212 472-7170
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, so it&#39;s on the Upper East Side. It&#39;s still a nice bookstore. Very Pleasant with a selection of the latest editions in literature and general non-fiction. Pretty mainstream stuff for the most part, but they have started their own &amp;#8220;Chapbook Series&amp;#8221; publishing and a &amp;#8220;First Editions Club&amp;#8221; if that&#39;s your sort of thing. I consider myself a reader, not a collector, but I do like to see bookshop owners venturing out and doing interesting things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shakeandco.com/index.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Shakespeare &amp;amp; Co.&quot;&gt;Shakespeare &amp;#038; Co.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;939 Lexington Ave. (at 69th)
&lt;br /&gt;212 570-0201
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
137 E. 23rd St. (at Lexington)
&lt;br /&gt;212 505-2021
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
716 Broadway (at Washington Pl.)
&lt;br /&gt;212 529-1330
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are more Shake &amp;#038; Co. locations than I&#39;ve listed. The one on broadway tends to have somewhat subversive collection, but otherwise all of the stores are fairly mainstream. Some sell textbooks, most sell magazines, but light on the journals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Crawford Doyle&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;21 E 90th St
&lt;br /&gt;212 289 2345
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ah, another Upper East Sider. Whenever I brush off my passport to go to that side of town I try to stop by Crawford Doyle. It&#39;s small and sells mostly new paperbacks and general non-fiction, but they do have an interesting collection of rare books to look at. It&#39;s always fun for an occasional browse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coliseumbooks.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Coliseum Books&quot;&gt;Coliseum Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;11 West 42nd St. (Btwn 5th/6th Ave across from Bryant Park)
&lt;br /&gt;212 803-5890
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Coliseum is overrated. They seem to be trying to be all things to all people. Now they have a cafe and a not terribly helpful staff. The selection is spotty (my impression is that it was better before they moved to their new location) and doesn&#39;t seem to be too serious anywhere. i.e. I never find myself saying...&amp;#8220;I&#39;m looking for X book, maybe I should stop at Coliseum first.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.posmanbooks.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Posman Books&quot;&gt;Posman Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;9 Grand Central Terminal (Vanderbilt &amp;#038; 42nd Street)
&lt;br /&gt;212-983-1111
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Posman used to be a good bookstore. They used to be right next to NYU and carried textbooks and an interesting selection of some serious stuff that you might not find elsewhere. Now they are very general, they sell a lot of paperbacks and serve GCT commuters, not book lovers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.churchill-books.com/&quot;&gt;Chartwells Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;55 East 52nd St. (In the arcade of the Park Avenue Plaza building between Park &amp;#038; Madison Avenues)
&lt;br /&gt;212 308-0643
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This store is dedicated to books by and about Winston Churchill. Much of their inventory is on-line, but the smallish store is pleasant and quiet with a small collection of literature and things like military books or foreign affairs, mostly in hardbound.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Westsider Used &amp;#038; Rare&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2246 Broadway (at 80th)
&lt;br /&gt;212 362-0706
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are quite a few opportunities to buy used books around the Upper West Side. There are a lot of books being sold on tables on the street and there are little bookstores tucked away where you wouldn&#39;t know they are there, such as Gryphon Bookshop. One of them (the name escapes me) finally gave up and closed its dusty doors, but there are still others fighting the good fight. Westsider is one of them. Books stacked to its very tall ceiling (it has a loft, so the main floor is two stories), it&#39;s a fun place to pop into once in a while. As with most used bookstores, you never know what you will find. Unfortunately, the fiction section seems to be all paperbacks, which are not appealing to me because they&#39;ve already used a good part of their limited life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Biases:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This list is not meant to be a comprehensive list of stores. Here are my biases:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, these are only Manhattan shops, where, for the moment, I hang my hat and therefore buy my books. There are great bookstores that I know about in Brooklyn and upstate New York and the Berkshires, but then things start to get out of hand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This list is mostly concerned with literature and not special interests. In NYC there are bookstores that sell nothing but cookbooks, there are gay bookstores like the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore, there are travel bookstores, like the Complete Traveller (with an amazing used and rare travel book collection), stores that specialize in rare collectible books like Bauman&#39;s or Argosy, children&#39;s bookstores like Books of Wonder, art bookstores, and so on. Again, things would get out of hand if I were to try and write about all of them, and literature is my only interest in terms of the pastime of browsing for and buying books. I&#39;ve also only listed independent stores here because no one needs me to tell them about Barnes &amp;#038; Noble (although they do have a good annex on 18th st, their original store I think, where they have text books and such).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My last bias is that I really really like to find cheap used hardcover books; they last longer and tend not to have reader annotations (which I avidly add myself). I buy fiction, criticism and poetry. These stores are the places I go to find those things. If you know of a place worth checking out, I&#39;d love to hear about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Read widely, think well, and write often&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>If Kafka Only Knew About The Lit-blog Coop</title>
   <link href="/article/2005/04/08/if-kafka-only-knew-about-the-lit-blog-coop/"/>
   <updated>2005-04-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2005/04/08/if-kafka-only-knew-about-the-lit-blog-coop</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Do you recall the parable in Kafka&#39;s The Trial?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Before the Law stands a door-keeper. To this door-keeper there comes a man from the country who begs for admittance to the Law. But the door-keeper says that he cannot admit the man at the moment. The man, on reflection, asks if he will be allowed, then, to enter later. &#39;It is possible,&#39; answers the door-keeper, &#39;but not at this moment.&#39; Since the door leading into the Law stands open as usual and the door-keeper steps to one side, the man bends down to peer through the entrance. When the door-keeper sees that, he laughs and says: &#39;If you are so strongly tempted, try to get in without my permission. But note that I am powerful. And I am only the lowest door-keeper. From hall to hall, keepers stand at every door, one more powerful than the other...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now substitute &amp;#8220;Publishing&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Mainstream Media&amp;#8221; for &amp;#8220;the Law.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now throw all of that out because the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lbc.typepad.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Lit-blog Coop&lt;/a&gt; is here!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These are fascinating times indeed in the lit-blog world. Mark Sarvas (famously known as TEV) has married Talent and Innovation to do something good in the world of literature: Promote great books (four per year, to be exact) through the lit-blogging community.
&lt;/p&gt;

I am delighted to be involved. This represents a departure for me in terms of thinking more about contemporary fiction than I have in the past, but it feels important, experimental and just plain cool.

   <title>Being a lit-blogger can be a lot like being the bridge in the Mona Lisa</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
If you&#39;ve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; noticed the bridge in the Mona Lisa, then you know exactly what I mean.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Guardian and New York Times seem to have embraced the niche created by literary blogs. Most recently, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.guardian.co.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; has published their selection of &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.guardian.co.uk/links/areas_of_interest/general/links/0,6135,1406190,00.html&quot; title=&quot;top 10 literary blogs&quot;&gt;top 10 literary blogs&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; which includes some familiar names like &lt;a href=&quot;http://rakesprogress.typepad.com/rakes_progress/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Rake&quot;&gt;The Rake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://marksarvas.blogs.com/elegvar/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Elegant Variation&quot;&gt;TEV&lt;/a&gt;, and surprisingly lacks a few I would expect to see, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://maudnewton.com/blog/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Maud&quot;&gt;Maud&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.complete-review.com/saloon/index.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Literary Saloon&quot;&gt;Literary Saloon&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobylives.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Moby Lives&quot;&gt;Moby Lives&lt;/a&gt; and so many others that could easily fit into the &amp;#8220;top ten&amp;#8221; - a list that I assure you should not obligatorily include a site that was &amp;#8220;Updated only sporadically - once or twice a month, on average,&amp;#8221; or one without original content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Interestingly, some of the more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beatrice.com/archives/001156.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.complete-review.com/saloon/archive/200502a.htm#kr8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt;, those &amp;#8220;first tier&amp;#8221; popular lit-blogs aren&#39;t too happy about being left out. But the real problem is that the entire idea of a &amp;#8220;top 10&amp;#8221; list is so arbitrary and confined as to make it meaningless. The medium is too new to even know what the best is, what a lit-blog should be and what in the long-term will be valuable to readers. I have over 50 literary oriented sites on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsgator.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Newsgator&lt;/a&gt; account and most every one of them, commercial or not, popular or not, brings something unique to what has become required daily reading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, there are only so many blog-entries one can read every day and there are a growing number of sites out there, now that blogs are becoming more popular and the barrier to entry remains practically nil. Some blogs will never get any traction because of the time commitment these endeavors require and others will miss the mark or their authors will find the limits of their enthusiasm. But there are many sites, many that I, an avid reader and writer, have even yet to discover, and I wonder how can we all be contributing something worthwhile?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/images/monalisa-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/images/monalisa-2-tm.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;130&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; hspace=&quot;4&quot; vspace=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;Monalisa&quot; longdesc=&quot;Mona Lisa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;click for larger image&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the advantages of this world of democratic publishing is that we can fine tune our intake of information to what we find valuable. I tend to write about books by dead authors on this site and I am fairly unconstrained as to the length of my posts. That&#39;s what I enjoy and so I&#39;ve become comfortable with the fact that my site is not everyone&#39;s cup o&#39; tea; I&#39;m grateful for those that do read and comment. Conversely, I enjoy hearing about what&#39;s going on in the publishing world and with the hot new books being released by living authors (things I have little first-hand knowledge of), so I often find myself reading the sites that are quite the opposite of mine. You should hear me telling friends about this or that book they should read, when I only know about it from reading blogs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&#39;t spend much time trying to find new blogs because I&#39;ve invested a lot in finding and reading those that I already know. However, I&#39;m always open to new voices and interested in seeing new ways writers find to express themselves and carry on the conversation - the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaddis-drinking-club.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gaddis Drinking Club&lt;/a&gt; being an interesting attempt at bringing several people together to write on one topic (next time let&#39;s not choose a thousand page book).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But the greatest challenge lies in the future. The landscape is changing such that some sites are growing in prominence, which may have yet-to-be known implications, new writers are getting involved and commercial enterprises are jumping into the pile of pick-up sticks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now, the lit-blog world is a community of people settled by the commonality of their interests. But as has happened in the quaintest of hamlets, Wal-mart moves in and puts some of the locals out of business. The anecdotes about book deals influenced by blogs (one site has even published his blog posts as a book!), radio interviews and newspaper notices for the &amp;#8220;best&amp;#8221; bloggers can&#39;t help but to change the way writers approach their blogs. As I quoted in an earlier post on lit-blogs (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/09/most_things_und.html&quot;&gt;Most Things Underground Tend to Surface&lt;/a&gt;), the Economist magazine has said that blogging &amp;#8220;also creates small, tight groups of readers that could make ideal target audiences for advertisers. Like search engines, once considered loss leaders, there is therefore an opportunity for &#39;monetising something cool&#39;...&amp;#8221; We all know that when you start talking about money, things change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, I can only extrapolate from my own experience, but we blogging early adaptors - early adaptors indeed, that status confirmed by the bemused or empty looks we receive when we tell non-bloggers about our blogging - do this because we enjoy writing and we are very enthusiastic about the subject we have chosen to write about five or six days a week. For many, though probably not all, this is the only forum in which we are given the opportunity to write in such a way as to express our thoughts on a whim to whatever degree of depth we wish. There are a lot of these sites out there, and one just wonders as our hamlet grows into a city, will the resulting sprawl crowd out some of these great voices?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Scott has some related comments at his site on the role of Weblogs in &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://esposito.typepad.com/con_read/2005/02/blogs_and_liter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blogs and Literary Loneliness&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;

   <title>Gaddis’s Library of Babel</title>
   <link href="/article/2005/01/24/gaddis-s-library-of-babel/"/>
   <updated>2005-01-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2005/01/24/gaddis-s-library-of-babel</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;When it was announced that the Library contained all books, the first reaction was unbound joy. All men felt themselves the possessors of an intact and secret treasure.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;- J.L. Borges, The Library of Babel
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Gaddis&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Recognitions&lt;/em&gt; seems to be a vast repository of literary allusions and the best of modernist influence. But it ain&#39;t necessarily so, says Mr. Gaddis and Steven Moore. I recently picked up a copy of Steven Moore&#39;s &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/080577534X/bookenompolic-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;William Gaddis&quot;&gt;William Gaddis&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; his 1989 collection of criticism. The introductory chapter reviews Gaddis&#39;s literary influences and discusses the perception that, as Moore quotes Cynthia Ozick, &amp;#8220;Mr. Gaddis knows almost everything.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But allusion is just that and can&#39;t be mistaken for erudition. That is not to say that Gaddis was not well-read, but that his books were well researched and he wears his erudition on his sleeve, at least in &lt;em&gt;The Recognitions&lt;/em&gt; (to be clear, I think Gaddis is brilliant, which shows in his writing, writing that needs not allusiveness to prove itself).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, all of the religious references in the book can be traced, according to Moore, to &amp;#8220;a half dozen rather mundane sources.&amp;#8221; But Moore says that by the time Gaddis wrote J.R. more than two decades later, &amp;#8220;he became his own man and &#39;influences&#39; all but disappear into the vast machinery of his work.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems impossible to really know what influences an author when writing; looking at the 73 pages of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0156002612/bookenompolic-20&quot;&gt;footnotes&lt;/a&gt; to T.S. Eliot&#39;s (23 page) poem, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375759344/bookenompolic-20&quot;&gt;The Waste Land&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, you notice an awful lot of conjecture based upon possible references pieced together with a combination of criticism and biography. Following the biographical path, Moore cites Gaddis&#39;s Harvard education, where Dryden, Chaucer and Elizabethan drama were part of the regimen, which Gaddis was &amp;#8220;glad of.&amp;#8221; And logically, Moore uses Gaddis&#39;s own statements and paper trail to develop a sense of his influences. The most important of those is Dostoyevski and the 19th century Russians:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8220;Gaddis&#39;s love for nineteenth century Russian literature in general crops up in his novels, his letters, and in his few lectures, where references are made to the major works of Dostoyevski, Tolstoy (especially the plays), Gogol, Turgenev, Gorky, Goncharov, and Chekhov. Gaddis shares with these authors not only their metaphysical concerns and often bizarre sense of humor, but their nationalistic impulses as well.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moore also quotes Edward Wasiolek as saying that Gaddis pursues &amp;#8220;perhaps the most distinctive trait of Russian fiction, to trace out the extreme, but logically possible, reaches of human characteristic.&amp;#8221; I agree, except that, in my opinion, the &amp;#8220;reaches of human characteristic&amp;#8221; are at different extremes for 19th century Russians and the 20th century Americans that Gaddis wrote about.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another major influence was T.S. Eliot. I mentioned in an earlier post that Gaddis had at one point intended to incorporate every line from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0156332256/bookenompolic-20&quot;&gt;Four Quartets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; into the novel. While there are many lines peppered throughout, the entire poem is not there as far as I understand - I gave up on my efforts to spot them after a while. Also in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/11/reading_the_rec.html&quot; title=&quot;Chekhov&#39;s Mistress on The Recognitions&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, I quoted from Four Quartets, a passage that I thought was particularly apt. But Moore says that another poem is really at the heart of this novel: &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;The Recognitions&lt;/em&gt; can be read as an epic sermon with &lt;em&gt;The Waste Land&lt;/em&gt; as its text.&amp;#8221; I&#39;ve gone back and re-read these since beginning the book, and may, if I can come up with anything interesting to say, comment on them later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Without going into specifics, Moore cites as &amp;#8220;relevant,&amp;#8221; Sade&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Justine&lt;/em&gt;, Goethe&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Faust&lt;/em&gt;, Rilke&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Duino Elegies&lt;/em&gt;, Rimbaud&#39;s &lt;em&gt;A Season in Hell&lt;/em&gt;, Broch&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Sleepwalkers&lt;/em&gt;, Hesse&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Steppenwolf&lt;/em&gt;, Silone&#39;s &lt;em&gt;And he Hid Himself&lt;/em&gt;, some Ibsen, and Dante. Moore also quotes Gaddis as admitting &amp;#8220;that when he first read Kafka in his early twenties he was so stunned by what Kafka could do that he &#39;sat down and wrote some very bad Kafka, though I thought of it as good Kafka then&#39;.&amp;#8221; Being stunned by Kafka is a sentiment that I am sure many writers share, myself included, and I recall Gabriel Garcia Marquez making a similar statement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the English front, relevant writers include C. Bront&amp;#235;, Conrad, Forster, Waugh, Shakespeare, Langland, Kipling, T.E. Lawrence (as an aside, I tried to read &lt;em&gt;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&lt;/em&gt;, being a fan of Lawrence of Arabia, but found it dull. I always feel like I&#39;m missing something when I don&#39;t like something as important as that), Huxley, Graves, and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Among the Americans, Moore cite&#39;s Gaddis&#39;s Bard College (where he taught for a short while) reading list, including Dreiser, Bellamy, Sinclair, Miller&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Death of a Salesman&lt;/em&gt;, Salinger and even Dale Carnegie&#39;s &lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/em&gt;. Also, Hawthorne, Melville, &amp;#8220;some&amp;#8221; Emerson, Thoreau&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Waldon&lt;/em&gt;, West, Cummings (especially &lt;em&gt;1 x 1&lt;/em&gt;), Faulkner&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Sound and the Fury&lt;/em&gt;, and naturally Hemingway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[I would go into more detail, but this is feeling much too like an eighth grader&#39;s book report and I know I&#39;m capable of something in the ninth to tenth grade level.]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The names above sound like a good reading list for someone who wants to be a writer, perhaps only missing Stendhal, Proust (who Gaddis claims to have only read about 50 pages), the King James Bible, and...Joyce.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gaddis &amp;amp; Joyce&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1923, T.S. Eliot said of James Joyce&#39;s Ulysses, &amp;#8220;a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.&amp;#8221; No one knew the latter part of that statement better than William Gaddis, who joked that one academic essay went into so much &amp;#8220;minute detail&amp;#8221; on &lt;em&gt;The Recognitions&lt;/em&gt; debt to &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; that &amp;#8220;I was doubtful of my own firm recollection of never having read &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Gaddis, in a letter that Moore reprints to Joyce scholar, Grace Eckley, catalogs fairly precisely what he did (the Molly chapter of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Exiles&lt;/em&gt; and some of &lt;em&gt;Dubliners&lt;/em&gt;) and did not read of Joyce&#39;s and goes on to say after listing some other authors he did read, &amp;#8220;why bother to go on, anyone seeking Joyce finds Joyce even if both Joyce &amp;amp; the victim found the item in Shakespeare, read right past whole lines lifted bodily from Eliot &amp;amp;c, all of which will probably go on so long as Joyce remains an academic cottage industry.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I confess thinking myself that there must be a Joyce influence in here, and I find it amazing that someone of Gaddis&#39;s writerly disposition would have not read Joyce, and even more stunning that he didn&#39;t like Joyce&#39;s writing (Gaddis claims to not have finished Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man). T.S. Eliot was influenced, by his own admission, by Joyce and I often find that I feel compelled to read those who influenced those who are influencing me; that&#39;s the literary conversation into which I, like the kid who desperately wants to eat at the adult&#39;s table, can&#39;t resist trying to insinuate myself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jack Green says in his vociferous response to Gaddis&#39;s critics, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyx.net/~awestrop/ftb/ftb.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Fire the Bastards!&quot;&gt;Fire the Bastards!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8220;ulysses &amp;amp; the recognitions are very &amp;#8221;20thcentury&amp;#8220; &amp;amp; have a number of technical resemblances: both are long &amp;amp; closely organized; sharp contrast between humorous &amp;amp; nonhumorous passages; lots of blasphemy; modeling/parodies on classics &amp;amp; extensive crossreferences (ulysses having much more of former, recognitions of latter); &amp;#8221;timegrowth&amp;#8220; in rereading; many nonfictional references (miscalled &amp;#8221;erudition&amp;#8220;) to give desired tones to the fiction; passion for other books; importance of ideas of major characters (dedalus, wyatt); delight in carrying humorous situations to extremes; restraint as basic technique of style but the worlds of the 2 books arent alike, nor are the characters the 2 have little resemblance in the essential ie artistic sense.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At least acknowledging the similarities, Green&#39;s beef on this point is the critics&#39; use of Joyce as an easy way out of thinking critically about the book. Indeed, it is too easy, considering that Moore gives us someone else to hang on to here. Ronald Firbank. Who? Described as a writer of &amp;#8220;high camp comedy of manners and part fairy tail,&amp;#8221;Firbank, an English writer who died in 1926, seems to wax and wane in popularity. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centerforbookculture.org/dalkey/backlist/firbank.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Center for Book Culture&quot;&gt;Center for Book Culture&lt;/a&gt; (Dalkey Archive Press) has some of his books as well a few quotes and biographical details.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moore claims Firbank, whose popularity was rising around the time Gaddis wrote &lt;em&gt;The Recognitions&lt;/em&gt;, may have been a source for &amp;#8220;elliptical dialogue - especially for effects usually achieved only in traditional exposition - and perhaps to have campy fun at Catholicism&#39;s expense.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just like Joyce&#39;s influence from the then out-of-print Dujardin, not all of the books in Gaddis&#39;s &amp;#8220;Library of Babel&amp;#8221; are part of the Western Canon that we all take for granted.

   <title>In Praise of the Sublimely Unhip</title>
   <link href="/article/2004/10/07/in-praise-of-the-sublimely-unhip/"/>
   <updated>2004-10-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2004/10/07/in-praise-of-the-sublimely-unhip</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not too many years ago, I had a friend whose wife worked for a prominently fashionable clothing company. Nearly everyone she knew was Italian and worked in the fashion industry. I occasionally hung out with this crowd, going to clubs and even at times going to parties where we cooly walked through phalanxes of flashing paparazzi to make our way in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now the funny thing is that back then, I worked in a corporate job (before the corporate world went khaki, thankfully). I herded around with my hip friends mostly wearing a standard issue suit and stood out as if I were a body guard instead of a fashionista.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a testament to the quality of the group, they accepted me as I was, even though I never really fit in. One very late night, one of the girls decided that my suit wouldn&amp;#8217;t do and she unbuttoned my shirt a bit and put my collar on the outside of my lapel. It was not until the next day that I realized how ridiculous I looked, and that was the beginning of the end of my flirtation with being hip.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a very long way around saying that I am not hip (if my sisters are reading this, I am sure they are laughing by now, because they know how true that statement is).&amp;nbsp; I don&amp;#8217;t look hip, and certainly what I read is not hip.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That leads to two fairly new publications that seem to me to stand in contrast to one another in terms of their hipness and so many other aspects. One is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zemblamagazine.com/&quot;&gt;Zembla&lt;/a&gt;, which is on their sixth issue; the other is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nplusonemag.com/&quot;&gt;n+1&lt;/a&gt;, which is yet to publish their second issue. I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned both here before and it&amp;#8217;s no secret by now which of these I prefer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I picked up my first issue of Zembla, the &amp;#8220;new international literary magazine,&amp;#8221; I was excited by the prospect of finding &amp;#8220;the most exciting book reviews&amp;#8221; and the &amp;#8220;fun with words&amp;#8221; that the cover touted. Zembla, by the way, is a Nabokovian term and the name of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/ozemble.htm&quot;&gt;official site&lt;/a&gt; of the International Vladimir Nabokov Society. There doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to be any affinity between the ventures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first article I came across (in issue 4) was a piece called &amp;#8220;Judging a Book by its Cover.&amp;#8221; Forgetting for a second that I immediately disagree with the premise, the writing was so pretentious and materialistic that I nearly threw the magazine away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The article equates the &amp;#8220;dynamism&amp;#8221; of a book with how large the text is and thus, how quickly one turns the pages; that being one argument for reading first editions and &amp;#8220;gaining access to the text as it first appeared to the world.&amp;#8221; To suggest that reading a modern paperback novel instead of an expensive first edition is like drinking &amp;#8220;champagne from a disposable plastic beaker&amp;#8221; misses entirely the point of reading. In fact, I might add, to extend the simile, that great champagne would probably taste so, no matter the medium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Somehow in this very short article, the author manages to cover his distaste for &amp;#8220;tinpot academics&amp;#8221;, paperbacks, cheesy book covers and critics: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I have long borne a grudge against the critics, carping &lt;i&gt;in camera&lt;/i&gt; at errors and inconsistencies, private irritations that have only rarely found public expression in vitriolic ink.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Yes, I too &amp;#8220;carp &lt;i&gt;in camera&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;#8221;
&lt;p&gt;
Most of the magazine is visually oriented with far more graphics than text. As it turns out, when they said &amp;#8220;fun with words&amp;#8221;, they meant that they would splash them across the page like a child playing pick-up sticks, not in a literary sense. To wit, a supposed posthumous interview with Robert Louis Stevenson was barely readable because the text was sprawled across the page in multi-colored triangles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The original writing (the issue contains a piece by Sylvia Plath) is not bad and there are articles on interesting topics, such as Drum magazine, and Bob Geldof, who is tellingly characterized as an &amp;#8220;old geezer&amp;#8221;. As I suppose would be required by a literary magazine, we are told how much the &amp;#8220;furiously passionate and passionately furious&amp;#8221; Geldof likes to read contemporary philosophy and history. But if we&amp;#8217;re not impressed by his erudition, we are told - in the same sentence - about how the rock promoter counts among his friends important heads of state and tribal chiefs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When the author of the Geldof article prefaces a statement on African colonization with &amp;#8220;In the simplistic terms dictated by the confines of a magazine article,&amp;#8221; I knew I was in the wrong place. In sum, Zembla is the literary version of something along the lines of a lifestyle magazine, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wallpaper.com/&quot;&gt;Wallpaper*&lt;/a&gt;. Not that there&amp;#8217;s anything wrong with that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In stark contrast to Zembla, stands &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nplusonemag.com/&quot;&gt;n+1&lt;/a&gt; magazine with its red cover and near absence of graphics. The title alone evokes bad memories of calculus classes and states to me that the editors of this journal are clearly looking to find readers that consider themselves smart and that point is driven home by the articles listed on the cover, such as &amp;#8220;The Intellectual Scene&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Against Exercise,&amp;#8221; because we all know that smart folks don&amp;#8217;t go to the gym.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My first foray in the initial issue, subtitled &amp;#8220;negation&amp;#8221; I was amused by the somewhat audacious manner in which the editors chose to declare their space in the world of cultural journals. The editorial statment makes it clear that we live, despite &amp;#8220;superstores&amp;#8221; full of cultural magazines, in a repressed state where pornography and restaurant reviews are our literature. &amp;#8220;The intellectual Scene&amp;#8221; goes on to declare in a cozy &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221; that &lt;i&gt;The New Republic&lt;/i&gt; is the &amp;#8220;designated hater&amp;#8221; of journals and James Wood wants &amp;#8220;to be his own grandfather;&amp;#8217; McSweeney&amp;#8217;s is considered in the past tense as a briefly significant magazine, and the &lt;i&gt;the Weekly Standard&lt;/i&gt; is, well I&amp;#8217;m not sure why that magazine is included in this line up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this is understandable, just as the newly imprisoned convict immediately kicks ass on the biggest guy in the yard his first day, a journal has to put its feet firmly on the ground to survive in an overcrowded marketplace.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But as skeptical and slightly put-off as I started, I soon found n+1 quite a good journal. It&amp;#8217;s articles are very well written, middling long in length - about right - and it covers topical issues in, I think, unique ways. Marco Roth&amp;#8217;s piece &amp;#8220;Why Literature Matters When It&amp;#8217;s Somewhere Else&amp;#8221; puts Azar Nafisi&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;Reading Lolita in Tehran&lt;/i&gt; in context of what reading means to us as individuals, but also more broadly in terms of what reading means in other cultures compared to our own, about which he points out &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Even in our free society there are Americans - lots of them - who are intimidated, who make bad choices or no choices, whose lives are a script written by others more powerful.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#8217;s the mark of a skilled writer when we are deftly carried from a story about one book into a conversation about a broad and important theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While that was probably the best article, others stand out too. &amp;#8220;Eggers, Teen Idol; or, The Education of Gary Baum&amp;#8221; is a vicarious view into the world of an idolatrous young blogger in Calabasas California who manages, at the pimply age of sixteen, to tap into the literati scene in New York - at least for a while, before things get ugly. An article about Russian oil tycoons veers into a statement of how beliefs inform our perceptions of what we read.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A compellingly topical article called &amp;#8220;Mogadishu, Baghdad, Troy&amp;#8221; relates current events to the mythological story of the Iliad. While comparing Baghdad to Troy might at first seem trite, Mark Grief, the author makes us think about the destructive resolve of the Greeks by closing with ... &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;resolve is a word that has been grossly misused in recent months, and yet is most relevant&amp;#8230; Our resolve is a public self-discovery that has yet to be made.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve previously mentioned the n+1&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nplusonemag.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, which continues to engage readers between issues and I&amp;#8217;ve also mentioned the Zembla site, which continues to engage those that prefer pictures that slide by the screen to actual content. The sites seem to be representative of their respective journals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because of my opinion about n+1, I was surprised when I saw at &lt;a href=&quot;http://maudnewton.com/blog/index.php?p=4186&quot;&gt;Maud&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; an excerpt from the n+1 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nplusonemag.com/conversation.html&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; relating the difficulties of a new journal trying to sell itself on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (where I live and where n+1&amp;#8217;s editorial home is located) because...&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bookseller: Yes, like I told you, it&amp;#8217;s not a hip crowd. It&amp;#8217;s not a cutting-edge crowd. These people do not want the new edgy, cutting-edge&amp;#8212;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
n+1: We&amp;#8217;re not&amp;#8212;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bookseller: &amp;#8212;they do not want the hip hot new thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both magazines seem to be true to their editorial mandate and probably entertain their respective audiences, so I imagine its just a matter of personal style.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So consider the above in praise of the sublimely un-hip; may they not be perceived as too &amp;#8220;cutting-edge&amp;#8221; to be successful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Read widely, think well, and write often.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Most Things Underground Tend to Surface</title>
   <link href="/article/2004/09/25/most-things-underground-tend-to-surface/"/>
   <updated>2004-09-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2004/09/25/most-things-underground-tend-to-surface</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I suppose it&#39;s like noticing white Toyotas on the road once you have one, but blogs seem to be getting a lot of press lately. Lit blogs get noticed in a Book Babes &lt;a href=&quot;http://poynter.org/content/content_print.asp?id=71720&amp;amp;custom=&quot; id=&quot;71720&amp;amp;custom=&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://poynter.org/&quot;&gt;Poynter&lt;/a&gt; On-line (link from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beatrice.com/archives/000763.html&quot;&gt;Beatrice&lt;/a&gt;). Lit blogs have gotten their fair share of attention, but it is the news and political blogs in this election season that are really getting talked about.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The serious press have even devoted some ink to blogs, like this article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ft.com&quot;&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; website, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ft.com/cms/s/d70a0844-0d94-11d9-a3e1-00000e2511c8.html&quot;&gt;Blogs and Bias&lt;/a&gt;, which is really an article about media fragmentation. But among other things, the article says that bloggers were quicker to the punch on the CBS forged W documents than the rest of the press.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How do they do it? Read Maud Newton&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://maisonneuve.org/article.php?article_id=411&quot; id=&quot;411&quot;&gt;Maisonneuve article&lt;/a&gt; that is as much about obsession as blogging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com&quot;&gt;Economist&lt;/a&gt; has mentioned blogs in context of the media several times and recently has carried an article called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=1994135&quot; id=&quot;1994135&quot;&gt;Golden Blogs&lt;/a&gt; where they point out, in their economist way that &amp;#8220;it also creates small, tight groups of readers that could make ideal target audiences for advertisers. Like search engines, once considered loss leaders, there is therefore an opportunity for &#39;monetising something cool&#39;...&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Interestingly, when I was at the World Leadership Forum this week, one of the tech panels included a top exec at Gartner, who, on top of all the exciting technical hahoos he mentioned, seemed most excited about the Wiki concept, imbodied by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; site that I mentioned in an earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/09/over_one_millio.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why is that interesting? Of all the exciting technical gadgets, the one thing that is most exciting to this guy who lives and breaths technology is the relatively low-tech concept of Wiki, which is similar to a blog, but is more collaborative in that others can add to and edit work over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think blogs may head that way in time and we&#39;ve already seen some excellent collaboration at &lt;a href=&quot;http://noggs.typepad.com/the_reading_experience/2004/09/gilbert_sorrent.html&quot;&gt;The Reading Experience&lt;/a&gt; with dueling book reviews.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other developments include &lt;a href=&quot;http://allconsuming.net/&quot;&gt;All Consuming&lt;/a&gt;, a site that tracks blog comments on books, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kinja.com/&quot;&gt;Kinja&lt;/a&gt;, a site trying to tame the vastness of blogs into a portal format.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, as the editor of Maisonneuve says in the Oct/Nov issue (the one with the Maud article on blogging), &amp;#8220;most things underground tend to surface.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Read widely, think well, and write often.&lt;/em&gt;

   <title>Proust Changed My Life, But Now I have Status Anxiety</title>
   <link href="/article/2004/08/17/proust-changed-my-life-but-now-i-have-status-anxiety/"/>
   <updated>2004-08-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/article/2004/08/17/proust-changed-my-life-but-now-i-have-status-anxiety</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I enjoy Alain de Botton&amp;#8217;s books, but I don&amp;#8217;t really like to admit it. It&amp;#8217;s not as though they&amp;#8217;re trashy novels, but they seem to have the scent of pseudo-intellectual manuals for wannabes. Maybe that&amp;#8217;s me, I don&amp;#8217;t know, but here is my reader&amp;#8217;s journey through de Botton&amp;#8217;s world.
My first encounter was with the work that will probably immortalize him, &lt;i&gt;How Proust Can Change Your life&lt;/i&gt;, which I picked up from the shelf (where it is always placed with In Search of Lost Time instead of in the d&amp;#8217;s), thumbed through thinking nothing more than that it was cute, and put it back.
Some time later I came across &lt;i&gt;The Consolation of Philosophy&lt;/i&gt; while looking for Boethius&amp;#8217; slightly older tome of the same name. Now gee, I thought, that&amp;#8217;s interesting, so I bought it, read it like a gossip column and was not exactly consoled by learning that, for instance, Schopenhauer was lonely. The book seemed to excel at pithy summations like: &amp;#8220;Happiness may be difficult to obtain. The obstacles are not primarily financial.&amp;#8221; Great, a fortune cookie, I thought. Still, it was enjoyable to read and some of the biographical information on famous philosophers was interesting.
Then one day, while browsing through Ivy&amp;#8217;s bookstore, I eyed a handsome hardback copy of de Botton&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;The Art of Travel&lt;/i&gt;. Aye, thought I, that could be interesting as it was on a subject that I had long thought about. The concept of authentic traveling, as in, to quote Bowles, &amp;#8220;I am a traveler, not a tourist&amp;#8221; as well as the way that we &amp;#8220;see&amp;#8221; things when traveling, which Walker Percy wrote about, is fascinating to me. I couldn&amp;#8217;t help it; I bought it, even though I rarely pay $23 for a book. My first impression, after never having bothered to think anything about this author, was that he was a very old man with a grandiloquent writing manner and somewhat stodgy tastes.
The &lt;i&gt;Art of Travel&lt;/i&gt; begins:
&amp;#8220;It was hard to say when exactly winter arrived. The decline was gradual, like that of a person into old age, inconspicuous from day to day until the season became an established, relentless reality.&amp;#8221;
It&amp;#8217;s actually a nice beginning, but set a tone for the book in which he discusses Flaubert and Wordsworth as if they were old friends. I soon found out though, that de Botton was only in his early thirties and had actually made something of a franchise for himself writing these whimsical didactic books on art and love and philosophy, and of course, Proust. After having found out that he was so young, the writing style and subject matter seemed to me a bit pretentious. An invalid impression really, but that&amp;#8217;s how I felt.
I was soon rewarded however; within the first twenty pages de Botton hit upon a statement seemingly right out of Percy:
&amp;#8220;It is unfortunately hard to recall our quasi-permanent concern with the future, for on our return from a place, perhaps the first thing to disappear from memory is just how much of the past we spent dwelling on what was to come - how much of it, that is, we spent somewhere other than where we were.&amp;#8221;
This is one of de Botton&amp;#8217;s better observations, but the book revolves around these profound statements, each reinforced by evidence from some respected dead person. By the end, I couldn&amp;#8217;t say that I was a better traveler, but again, the book was enjoyable enough. It could be dull here and there and while it had structure, it seemed to have little real point; it was simply an enjoyable read under the guise of something a bit weightier.
I guess it was inevitable that I would eventually read &lt;i&gt;How Proust Can Change Your Life&lt;/i&gt;, since that is where the journey began. In late 2003, the Lydia Davis translation of &lt;i&gt;Swann&amp;#8217;s Way&lt;/i&gt; was released (I bought the 6 volume set from Amazon U.K., which will not be released for sometime in the U.S., probably at least, until I get to reading them, but no matter). I was ready to go back for some more Proust and thought it would be a good time to read de Botton&amp;#8217;s book as an aside.
This, of all his books, reads most like a self-help manual. It&amp;#8217;s full of pithy conclusions on topics such as friendship, emotions and reading, supported, in this case, by the writings or biography of the slightly hermetic literary genius, Marcel Proust. By now, I had enough experience with the ways of Mr. de Botton to know that I would not learn anything, but would enjoy having a conversation, in a way, about M. Proust. My expectations were met. I did like the part where de Botton chastises idolators for going to Illiers-Combray on pilgrimages to see the quasi-fictional setting for Proust&amp;#8217;s boyhood in &lt;i&gt;In Search of Lost Time.&lt;/i&gt; I agreed with the sentiment and was glad that he said it, being that, I would suppose, many of those pilgrims would be reading this very book.
And that brings me to &lt;i&gt;Status Anxiety&lt;/i&gt;, which my wife bought me, at my request, for Father&amp;#8217;s day (my first by the way). I know what I&amp;#8217;m getting into here, but I still have mixed emotions about where these books fit. &lt;i&gt;Status Anxiety&lt;/i&gt; begins with a chapter on &amp;#8220;Our Need for Love, Our Desire for Status.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m just not interested, but somehow simultaneously compelled to read it.
I guess I&amp;#8217;m just jealous in a - I wish I thought of that - kind of way. Ultimately, I like de Botton&amp;#8217;s books for no other reason than the subject matter usually revolves around something interesting, even if the ostensible topic does not, and they are easy reads. So I&amp;#8217;m jealous because I should be writing fun pointless books like that instead of merely pointless blog entries like this.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was inspired by a comment on yesterday&amp;#8217;s post to write this, but this is also a good time to mention Gotham Book Mart because it is finally making a long anticipated move to a new location after 58 years at the old site and 84 years in existence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and Borders have vast shelves of books on seemingly every topic, practically decent coffee shops and a friendly staff. I have a well worn B&amp;amp;N discount card that I use at the &amp;#8220;superstore&amp;#8221; 3 blocks from my house whenever I need something quickly or it&amp;#8217;s raining &amp;#8211; and it rains all too frequently in these parts. Amazon is also amazing with its great prices and an apparently infinite selection of books; those smiley boxes (you know what I&amp;#8217;m talking about) appear from nowhere on my doorstep as if manna from heaven. So why bother with any other book store?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t honestly say. Perhaps for a sense of discovery? Maybe there&amp;#8217;s an ineffable essence that one picks up in a bookstore where the buyer, the one who is responsible for every book on the shelf, is not stuffed away in a centrally located cubicle, but is the owner or manager standing close by to answer your questions. Could it be the randomness of the mingled used and new books stacked from floor to ceiling, some long out of print, others you&amp;#8217;ve just never heard of before? Is it that hard back copy of &lt;i&gt;The Magic Mountain&lt;/i&gt; or some other great novel that will live far longer than its $6.98 price tag would suggest? We could just chalk it up to all these, plus a bit of mysticism, but when it comes down to it, great bookstores have more than just books, they have soul and they&amp;#8217;re not just a store, but a destination. Gotham Book Mart is one of those places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking into the Gotham for the first time, you don&amp;#8217;t immediately get the sense of history that goes along with the dusty stacks and the fat cat laying in the back (named Tom, after Pynchon). Unless you already know beforehand, you may not even realize it on your first visit. But then, as you linger over the shelves for a while, you begin to notice that most of the pictures of literary luminaries hanging on the scarce wall space were probably taken right there and the others are inscribed to the owner of the store. According to its web-site the store has counted among its customers W.H.&amp;nbsp; Auden, Randall Jarrell, Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, Anais Nin, Thornton Wilder, J.D. Salinger, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams among others in an exhaustively famous list of literary lions (some are in the photo below, for a key to the faces, go the Gotham web-site linked at the end of this piece). Maybe some of these people would have gone to Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, but they never would have become a part of the fabric of any generic superstore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;gothamwriters25&quot; src=&quot;http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/images/gothamwriters25.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frances Steloff opened Gotham Book Mart in 1920 after selling books from her window with a sign that said &amp;#8220;Interesting Books Selected by Myself.&amp;#8221; Ms. Steloff lived for 101 years and in the store&amp;#8217;s early years she was very much a part of the literary scene in New York City. According to the website: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gotham and Miss Steloff championed the experimental and challenged the  censors over the years.&amp;#160; She supplied James Joyce&amp;#8217;s books to US readers  as they were  published, including those with legal difficulties from the US&amp;#8217;s obscenity  laws, a service she also provided for D.H. Lawrence and Henry Miller&amp;#8217;s  work.&amp;#160; She was one of the founding members of the James Joyce Society,  whose meetings continue at the Gotham, and Joyce himself occasionally ordered books directly from Miss  Steloff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once at Gotham I saw a first edition copy of the Paris Review&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;Writers at Work&lt;/i&gt; collection, the second in the series, published in 1963. This book had a famous interview with Ernest Hemingway, along with Boris Pasternak, T.S. Eliot, Ralph Ellison, and many others. I wasn&amp;#8217;t interested in paying for the first edition (I&amp;#8217;m a reader not a collector), so I asked Flip, the manager, for another copy. He dug that and others out for me, and the conversation evolved from there to talk about Joyce and Borges. Next thing I know, he&amp;#8217;s making phone calls to find information for me on an exhibit of Borges books (sadly) brought from Argentina for sale. That&amp;#8217;s what I call a Superstore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But besides that book-culture thing you get from shopping there, which I&amp;#8217;m sure will remain even after the move, Gotham is just a great place to browse. They really do have books stacked from floor to ceiling, many of them at great prices and the combination of new and used books jostling for your attention assures that you will always find something interesting. For all the books that they have laying around the store, a recent NY Times article says that there are 200,000 more in the back room, and hopefully some of those will make it out into the daylight at the new shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;gotham&quot; src=&quot;http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/images/gotham.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;217&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotham specializes in contemporary fiction, but besides that, they also have quite a few specialty areas, too numerous to mention. They tend to segregate books in interesting ways. Classics are together as well as Romantic period books, there&amp;#8217;s a film section, a decent selection of literary criticism, and mysteries (if I remember correctly) and biography are segregated, and of course, there&amp;#8217;s a  special section for James Joyce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poetry section is bewilderingly thorough with all the familiar names intermixed with soon-to-be familiar names. Authors like Dante, Auden, Eliot and Yeats and Pound have their own sections, tucked away toward the bottom of the shelves. As a compliment to all the great books, Gotham has an incredible selection of literary journals. Because of the nature of these little slices of obscurity, there are often back issues laying on the shelves too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreas Brown, Gotham&amp;#8217;s current owner, sold the building where the store is located last year and just recently signed a long-term lease for the H.P. Kraus building a block away. I and other regular patrons had been asking about the move for some time, but the employees were mum. I had not been in for a while, so was surprised when I saw the notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting that an independent bookstore is thriving among the price and inventory competition of the national chains. Those that are surviving must be offering something more, and I think Gotham Book Mart is exemplary of what a great bookstore can and should be. Long live Gotham! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will conclude with the following excerpt from the August 4th New York Times article regarding Gotham&amp;#8217;s move:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Both buildings have five stories, but the Kraus has about twice the space, Mr. Brown said. It is lined with bookcases, many of them antique. The second floor has a ballroom-size open area that will be used for publication parties and meetings of the James Joyce Society and other groups. At the old Gotham there was often an overflow crowd for such occasions. In the window at the Kraus building is a raised platform, which could be used as a stage for theatrical events.
&lt;p&gt;The third floor, where Kraus and his wife, Hanni, held conferences and entertained important clients, will become an art gallery. The upper floors will be used for office and storage space and as a place to develop a Gotham Web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks Mr. Brown and his employees have been packing books and archival photographs and moving them to the new location. Regarding the clutter at the 46th Street store, he said that the old Gotham was messier when its founder, Frances Steloff, was alive. (She opened the store in 1920 and moved twice, staying within a two-block area.) When he bought it, he installed air-conditioning and tried to impose order on the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The more I straightened things out,&amp;#8221; he said, &amp;#8220;the more customers complained.&amp;#8221; They were apparently attracted to the chaos, hoping to stumble on some serendipitous find. That kind of environment appealed to Mr. Brown as a book buyer, but not as a bookseller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gotham sign, &amp;#8220;Wise Men Fish Here,&amp;#8221; which was designed by the artist John Held Jr., will soon be placed on the facade of the new location. Will wise men still be able to fish for books at the new Gotham? &amp;#8220;I think they will,&amp;#8221; Mr. Brown said, and, thinking about the disorder in the old shop, he added, &amp;#8220;but it will be more like a lake.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Whither Copyright when the Reader Becomes the Curator?</title>
   <link href="/article/0001/12/04/whither-copyright-when-the-reader-becomes-the-curator/"/>
   <updated>0001-12-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/0001/12/04/whither-copyright-when-the-reader-becomes-the-curator</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in 2010 I wrote a post here called “&lt;a title=&quot;Making Ebooks is as Easy as Blogging: My Instapaper(book) on Paul Muldoon&quot; href=&quot;http://ageofsand.budparr.com/Book Futurism/making-ebooks-is-as-easy-as-blogging/&quot;&gt;Making Ebooks is as Easy as Blogging: My Instapaper(book) on Paul Muldoon&lt;/a&gt;” that outlined a fairly easy process of putting together an e-book by collecting pieces from around the internet and adding them to my Instapaper account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Instapaper&quot; href=&quot;http://www.instapaper.com/&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; has a feature to download your saved articles to epub/Kindle. I just took my collected articles and an introduction from a blog post I made on my Tumblr account and voila! a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I assumed that I was breaking some copyright laws by doing this, but it was an experiment only and I had no intention of distributing it any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my mind, this sort of thing would soon become normal and perhaps obviate the publishing tradition of packaging a writer’s past essays and releasing them as a book. If such a collection’s value to a reader is in selection and packaging, that’s something that can easily be taken on by the reader (the new breed of “Curator”) if the articles were available. And why shouldn’t they be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today (well, a few months ago), and a service similar to Instapaper, called &lt;a title=&quot;Readability&quot; href=&quot;http://readability.com&quot;&gt;Readability&lt;/a&gt;, has institutionalized that process with a service called “&lt;a title=&quot;Readlists&quot; href=&quot;http://readlists.com/&quot;&gt;Readlists&lt;/a&gt;,” which some have likened to text “mix-tapes” for sharing a particular mix of articles on the web. This has caused a bit of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netmagazine.com/features/readlists-debate-ebook-repackaging-splits-industry&quot;&gt;kerfuffle&lt;/a&gt;, apparently, between the two services over whether or not this is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The salient point of the argument is this, according to the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netmagazine.com/features/readlists-debate-ebook-repackaging-splits-industry&quot;&gt;.net&lt;/a&gt;” article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Marco Arment, developer of Instapaper] said his &#39;read it later&#39; service Instapaper is justified through fair-use doctrine (in a similar way to how television can be legally time-shifted through using a PVR or VCR), but Readlists takes things too far: &quot;That service&#39;s mass redistribution of copyrighted content through public ebook-format downloads is definitely not fair use. Readlists crosses a significant line that Instapaper will not.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not qualified to say if he’s right, but I think there’s a certain inevitability in this sort of disintermediation. There’s a huge wave of “curating” going on now with all the social sharing sites; Readlists is in some ways a smart (my bias) version of a Pinterest board, is it not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I decided to begin using Wordpress for some of my development work. I dove in to as much information I could find - there’s a wealth of it - on the web. But I like the thought and order of a book. Among the fairly good and pretty good books I found were &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/ebooks/?pk_campaign=smashing-magazine-ebooks-tab&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine’s&lt;/a&gt; collection of Wordpress articles from their site. I believe (I haven’t verified this) that all the articles were available online, but for $5, I was happy to pay for their collecting them for me. Of course they originally published the articles so here there were no copyright issues, but the point is that form matters and the hyper hypertext of the web can sometimes use some context. I also created my own collection of articles in Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times published a collection of their web content on the Wikileaks episode, called “&lt;a title=&quot;Open Secrets&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/opensecrets/&quot;&gt;Open Secrets&lt;/a&gt;.” They added more content to their collection than what they had originally published, but there’s no reason that someone else couldn’t have made a similar collection and perhaps added other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in a bar last week that was playing music from Spotify, a (great) music subscription service. As far as I can tell from reviewing Spotify’s terms, that sort of ostensibly commercial use is a violation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmi.com/&quot;&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt;, the music rights management firm, actually sends agents out to inspect establishments to enforce musicians’ rights. That seems pretty daunting and expensive. Fortunately for copyright holders on the web there are “&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot&quot;&gt;bots&lt;/a&gt;” to do the same job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not it confounds owners of content, readers are quickly becoming accustomed to reading when and where they want and putting together content that makes sense to them. Reader as curator. I don’t think that will stop professional curators (publishers and editors) or writers packaging their own work just as they always have. The value of the act is still there, but if you expect to put a price on it, it’s going to have to be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>0001-12-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/article/0001/12/04/it-takes-a-big-telescope</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently dismissed a New Yorker blog post (“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/01/the-book-of-the-future-sliced-and-diced.html&quot;&gt;The Book of the Future, Sliced and Diced&lt;/a&gt;”, Jan. 22, 2013) on Twitter with the following quote by Jorge Luis Borges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I have dipped into books of aesthetics, but I had an uncomfortable feeling that I was reading the works of astronomers who had never looked at the stars. They were writing about poetry as if poetry were a task, and not what it really is, a passion, and a joy.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly apt because the post I was responding to quoted several new players in publishing technology characterizing books as “…an amount of knowledge that I feel good about finishing” and “a bag of words,” stripping away their essence, the shared consciousness a book of any kind represents. We could probably put a stake in the ground on the day Apple introduced the iPhone  - or perhaps the iPad  - and say that was the day the technologists became publishers. So what’s so bad about this?&lt;/p&gt;
