### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a great way to edit text so that your desired formatting is always intact no matter what editor you're using. It's increasingly used on the web as a way to ensure that a writer's intended formatting never gets lost.

You can edit Markdown files in any text editor, though there are are some, like [iA Writer for Macs](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/), that are specially built to make this easy way of writing even easier. 

### How do I write in Markdown?

Markdown is extremely simple. In fact, it's mostly plain text, so writing a paragraph would be the same as with any text editor (there's a line between each paragraph).

If you want to put in a line break  
you merely put two spaces after a line  
and it shows up like this.

#### Emphasis

If you want to make a word **bold**, you merely put two asterisks around it:  

``` like **this** ``` is  like **this** 

To emphasize a word with *italics* you put one asterisk around it:  

``` like *this*``` is  like *this* 

or

``` use an _underscore_ ``` to get the same results. 

_You can even use these same characters to emphasize complete sentences_.



#### Links

[Links are simple](https://www.google.com/search?q=markdown). Just put the text to be linked in [] brackets, and the link in () parenthesis.

#### Blockquotes

> When typing an extended quote, just put the "greater than" sign before the paragraph.

~~~ 

> "I have dipped into books of aesthetics, but I had an uncomfortable feeling that I was reading the works of astronomers who had never looked at the stars. They were writing about poetry as if poetry were a task, and not what it really is, a passion, and a joy."

#### Lists

- Using Lists is Easy
- Just use a dash with a space before each line

#### Headings

~~~

# The largest heading  
## The second largest heading  
â€¦
###### The 6th largest heading

~~~

#### Images

Images are just like links, but they have an exclamation point in front of them (and of course the link should be to where the image is!). The text between the brackets becomes the title, but it's not required.

If you're editing content in a Jekyll-based site, you can use the [prose editor](http://prose.io/), if your site is configured for it.
