        How Good Design Can Lead us to Freedom: On iPad Apps vs the Web, and Free
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2010</span>

    <p>A lot of smart <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/ipad-revolution/">people</a> are commenting <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/05/why-the-biggest-competitor-to-ipad-news-apps-may-be-a-familiar-face/">about</a> newspaper and magazine iPad apps as though the apps’ features are set in stone. There’s no reason for there not to be links within an app, for instance, and there’s no reason to think that the developers are ignorant of that fact. Yet, I’ve seen complaints about the lack of links and other fairly trivial aspects of iPad apps from several, usually more <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/i-prefer-safari-to-content-apps-on-the-ipad.html">perspicacious</a>, sources. While conceding that some publisher’s misguided belief they’ve “rethought” the magazine are so far off the mark, we should be looking at apps in context of readers, journalism, and the Web. Considering that apps are in their early stages of development vis-á-vis the browser’s relatively long history, news apps have got a leap ahead of Web sites in reader-experience terms alone.</p>

<p><em>The New York Times</em> and <em>Financial Times</em> are two instances of serious content apps that are not necessarily feature-rich now but have a business imperative to evolve, and the USA Today and <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2010/06/01/ews-must-see-must-list">Entertainment Weekly</a> apps are leading the way in design. They show great promise on the road to the newspaper becoming <em>merely</em> “the news.” I find myself gravitating to the comparably simpler <em>FT</em> and <em>Times</em> apps on my iPad, despite their lack of features, instead of the Web and certainly opposed to consuming content on my laptop, and I think in time others will too.</p>

<p>The apps’ point of value will arrive when they bring the most powerful features of the Web — personalized browsing, sharing, linking —  with a reading experience that the Web clearly lacks. It’s easy to see, looking at the screenshots below, how the app clearly gives us a better reading experience (though, as I’ve mentioned before, app design will spill over into better Web design too):</p>

<p><a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0009.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-165" style="margin-right: 15px" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0009-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a> <a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0010.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-166" style="margin-right: 15px" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0010-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>These are screenshots of the same article taken at the same time. The one on the left is from <em>The New York Times</em> on the Web via iPad’s Safari. The other is via <em>The New York Times</em> iPad app (n.b. the video embedded in the lower right.).</p>

<p>There’s no contest. The app is a better user experience, despite the — arguable — fact that <em>The New York Times</em> Web site is one of the better designed news sites out there.</p>

<p>With the app you can effortlessly turn the page (less effortlessly than turning the actual paper and without the time drag and disorientation of loading the next page of a Website), share the article (for the moment limited to email), watch a video, and return to the home screen. That’s it. The isolation and lack of options is a benefit to readers.</p>

<p>There is an easy to distinguish difference in the amount of noise on the page (this is why readers in the know gravitate to <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> - both lacking many of the “features” you’d find on Web sites).</p>

<p><em><a href="http://webstyleguide.com/">The Web Style Guide</a></em> points out a fundamental shortcoming of the Web (and one we designers are faced to deal with daily):</p>
<blockquote>Text on the computer screen is hard to read not only because of the low resolution of computer screens but also because the layout of most Web pages violates a fundamental rule of book and magazine typography: the lines of text on most Web pages are far too long for easy reading. Magazine and book columns are narrow for physiological reasons: at normal reading distances the eye's span of acute focus is only about three inches wide, so designers try to keep dense passages of text in columns not much wider than that comfortable eye span. Wider lines of text require readers to move their heads slightly or strain their eye muscles to track over the long lines of text. Readability suffers because on the long trip back to the left margin the reader may lose track of the next line.</blockquote>
<p>While the <em>Times’</em> app’s columns are meant to mimic print newspapers (a concept the <em>WSJ</em> app took way too far) rather than strike a balance of line length for good readability, the column widths here work well in the fixed space of the iPad’s screen and are far more readable than what we are presented with on Web sites. <em>The Times’ International Herald Tribune</em>, before it was folded into their global offerings, displayed articles in columnar format, so it is possible (though, I’ve tried and it’s difficult to pull off in a dynamic setting) to do that on the Web, but instead we are left with virtually a Web-wide one-size-fits-all text dump.</p>

<p><em>USA Today’s</em> app has a very clean interface and is easy to use and read. Despite a few issues begging for standard practices for app design, even in these early stages, the app is superior to both the Web site and to print:</p>

<p><a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/USA-Today-iPad-app-front-page.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-225" style="margin-right: 15px;clear: both" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/USA-Today-iPad-app-front-page-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/USA-Today-iPad-app-article.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-226" style="margin-right: 15px" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/USA-Today-iPad-app-article-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>I think — and the big publishers are betting — that people will pay for that enhanced experience when it’s backed with good journalism. Jacob Weisberg calls it <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2253821">“pretty;”</a> I call it good design.</p>

<p>There are three-quarters of a million people who still subscribe to <em>The Times</em>, which is not cheap, despite the free version on the Web. <em>Politico</em>, a profitable political news Web site, still maintains its print base. While there are lots of factors driving the legacy of print subscriptions, as tablets and readers improve and proliferate and the overall quality improves, print magazines and newspapers will have little reason to exist in their print form beyond sentimental reasons and we all know sentiment doesn’t pay the bills. While business models will certainly evolve, it’s erroneous to think that the business of journalism will merely cease to exist (that is, no one will pay for it) because there are free alternatives.</p>

<p>I’m as uncomfortable as anyone with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden_(technology)">“walled garden”</a> being imposed upon the Web in the name of consumerism. The iPad is a harbinger of the end of geekdom, or a new kind of geek. Lets face it, the Open Source era of the Web is not as free and open as it used to be. Everything is monetized; “free” is just another word for indirect monetization or the price of gaining marketshare. But free shouldn’t be a feature, particularly if the implicit costs are high. Think how earlier generations were duped into thinking that beef should be close to free. Now we’re finding that the cost of all that cheap beef is that it’s killing us, not to mention the destruction of our natural resources and the treatment of animals in factory farms.</p>

<p>One tech venture capitalist (whose name Newsweek seems to have lost) <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2010/02/25/the-future-won-t-be-free.html">points out</a> the irony of paying for print as though we are all aware that the physical object is somehow worth more than the information it contains:</p>
<blockquote>When I buy the dead-tree version of my local newspaper, I have no expectation that it should be free. If I pick it up and walk out of the coffee shop without paying, that's stealing. But when I walk upstairs to my office and log on to the Web site for the same paper, I feel a divine right to access the entirety of that paper—and 10 years of its archives—for free.</blockquote>
<p>Just as we have allowed our listening experience to be cheapened by the convenience of mp3s, we’ve allowed our reading experience to be cheapened by the freedom of the Web (this spoken, mind you, from a Web designer and avid blogger approaching his eighth year). Among other things (and granted, this isn’t just a Web problem), the prospect of the “news” being driven more by political-backed bias machines rather than objective journalism leaves me with an uneasy feeling. There is a democratic imperative to pay for serious journalism, where, as <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/sep/24/the-times-amp-the-internet/">Bill Keller</a> says (in reply to <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/michael-massing/">Michael Massing’s</a> interesting pieces in <em>The New York Review of Books</em> on news and the internet) to “go places, bear witness, develop sources, dig, and explain, and trust readers to draw their own conclusions.”</p>

<p>While it may sound trivial to say that design — much less the design of iPad apps — can lead us out of the mess that the field of journalism finds itself in, it is a critical first step on the road to a new media business model. Richard Lanham writes in his seminal book, <em>The Economics of Attention:</em></p>
<blockquote><em> </em>The most obvious new group of attention economists may be the computer-human interface designers. This branch of information design subsumes all the efforts at Web site design, amateur and professional, which we encounter on our daily voyage through cyberspace. The Internet constitutes the pure case of an attention economy. "Eyeballs" constitute the coin of the realm....the economics that matters in this new theater, is design.</blockquote>

        #FridayReads - Incantation by Laughter and The Thing Around Your Neck

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 May 2010</span>

    <p>We had a little party the other night to celebrate the release of <em><a href="http://wordswithoutborders.org/books/#the-ecco-anthology-of-international-poetry">The Ecco Anthology of International Poetry</a></em>. Twenty or so people gathered in a beautiful Manhattan apartment with the treat of having the renowned poet, and president of the Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, Edward Hirsch read to us from the anthology. It’s a massive collection so to pick a couple of poems to represent the whole is difficult, but Hirsch picked one that I think actually represents the challenges of poetry and translation. The poem is Velimir Khlebnikov’s “Incantation by Laughter” in which Khlebnikov riffs, in Russian, on the various ways to express laughter in his language. Paul Schmidt did a fantastic job of creating something that I have to imagine recreates the original while creating something wholly new. Here are the first five lines:</p>
<blockquote>Hlahla! Uthlofan, lauflings!

Hlahla! Uflofan, lauflings!

Who lawghen with lafe, who hlaegen lewchly,

Hlahla! Uflofan hlouly!

Hlahla! Hloufish lauflings lafe uf beloght lauchalorum!</blockquote>

<p>I’ve also been reading Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s stories collected in <em>The Thing Around Your Neck.</em> This book will be passed around from English and writing teachers to students for years to come. Her stories are flawless. Perhaps even a bit too good. Emotionally distant. Though that may be unfair to say just yet. Here’s a video of her TED talk: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story.html">Chimamanda Adichie: The danger of a single story</a></p>

        Do Tools Matter? On Collaborative Writing
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 May 2010</span>

    <p>Matt Bell is a terrific writer and an exemplar of ‘born digital.’ If you follow writing circles online you will find Matt. That’s one reason  -two, actually - I’m watching his online writing exercise this week at “Everday Genius,” the online journal of the chapbook publisher Publishing Genius.</p>

<p>Matt’s week at “Everyday Genius” will begin with him starting a story on Monday, seeded from his “failure files” (his writing block isn’t so much as an ability to write, but an inability to write something he feels worthwhile to publish, he explains), then turning it over to two different authors over the course of the week, then over to the community at large, and then back to Matt on Friday to revise before they publish the final story on the site.</p>

<p>I like this exercise because it gives the author some level of control while mimicking not just collaborative writing, but the editorial process to a degree. At the very least it takes the writer out of his vacuum while leaving him in control of the final product.</p>

<p>Collaborative writing has been around for a long time. I have several books of not-bad attempts at it. Penguin UK (a leader among publishers in terms of their online work) recently attempted and failed a massive collaborative writing exercise, using a Wiki. Truthfully, it was too massive and showman-like to produce anything good, but perhaps served its purpose in the iterative sense of moving forward with possibilities. Ultimately though, too many cooks in the pot at the least, and I think that the exercise demonstrated that a wiki is not a place for “writing” so much as a place for “documenting.”</p>

<p>What’s interesting about “Everyday Genius’s” project is that it puts a lone writer on the line. This is brave because creative writing at its best comes from deep places within, yet the form Matt is doing this in is something akin to an art installation where the artist lives in a glass booth baring all to the world around him.</p>

<p>Here’s where the tools come in to play. Matt will be writing his story, along with his collaborators, on software called “EtherPad” (I’m not sure if they’ll be using their own installation of Etherpad, which went Opensource when Google bought the company who created it last year, but there’s an installation of it called “MeetingWords” available freely online).</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-122" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-17-at-2.06.36-PM-e1274119647557.png" alt="" width="300" height="186" /> The beauty of Etherpad is that it truly is real-time and it’s very easy to see who is doing what to the text. I’ve used it before to edit articles at “Dispatches” at <em>Words Without Borders</em> (as well its decidedly less real-time brethren, Writeboard). Writing on Etherpad is fun to watch, if a little eerie at first, as another person’s writing appears before your eyes. The software has a chat function where writers can talk about what they’re writing. Obviously there are implications here for all sorts of uses (n.b. Google Wave).</p>

<p>But what I think is really interesting - taking it back down to earth with “Everyday Genius’s” purpose - is how it affects one’s writing in a creative or critical sense. Is it possible that this can make for better writing? I know that from my perspective as an editor working with a writer it was incredibly productive.</p>

<p>One of the things I’ve been a student of over the past seven years of building Websites is watching how people interact with technology: how technology influences what they write; for instance, the difference between articles, blog posts, micro-blog posts, as an enabler or hindrance to certain types of writing. It’s plain to see that a piece written outside of the Web entirely (e.g. on MS Word, ugh) may be entirely different than one written in the control panel of a content management system or a bookmarklet popup. That might be due to technological noise - the inhibiting feel of a text-editor - but I think there’s a time factor at play as well.</p>

<p>As an aside of sorts, I often have to communicate to my Web design clients my design conceptions for their site. In the past I typically created a static mockup of the site and sent it to the client via email. Sometimes my design ideas don’t jive with the client’s expectations or there’s some element that I want the client to react to without me prompting them with expectations. This rarely works out well or smoothly, but I found that the more time that went by between when I sent the mockup to our discussion of it, the issues were always amplified to the same degree.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve begun to only reveal the design with the client when I have them on the phone, reviewing the designs then and there and making small changes as part of our conversation and instantly putting those changes up for them to see. What before seemed monumental tends to evaporate into just part of the discussion, even if the result is a bit less polished than it might have been the old way.</p>

<p>Writing sometimes loses its way. That’s why we have editors. But as any writer knows, it hurts quite a bit to see your words changed for you. I think shortening the distance between writer and editor, or writer and collaborator may stand to improve writing in general and the possibility of a form of writing that never has been able to get out of the gate. “Everyday Genius’s” exercise, along with sites like BookOven may go along way to getting us there.</p>

        What Web Media Can Learn from Print
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 May 2010</span>

    <p>With the death throes of Newsweek there are a lot of Web publishers wallowing in <a href="http://www.asylum.com/2010/05/07/an-open-letter-to-magazines-from-the-internet/">schadenfreude</a> as the scales are tipping in their direction. What Newsweek has shown is that there’s more to being successful on the Web than being there and even a shift from a weekly print mag to a daily news mag with a “best of” print edition will likely fail too.</p>

<p>Yet, at the same time I see Web media publishers scoff at print media attempts to monetize with pay-walls and dedicated apps, and even readers are up in arms at the prospect of paying for something they’ve gotten used to getting for free.</p>

<p>Firstly, the comments I’ve seen about, for instance, the New York Times’ iPad app, assume that this is a static phenomenon when the fact is that these apps can and will improve quickly and soon will be feature rich and create an incomparable user experience that readers will pay for.</p>

<p>The Web is great, but needs to improve as print readers complete the shift to online. I suspect that there will be a convergence of usability between dedicated apps and Websites, but just as print was slow to get the picture about the web, the web is slow to create a good reading experience.</p>

<p>When you hear someone say they like “holding” a paper in their hands what they really mean is that reading online sucks. It doesn’t have to be that way. The most popular news sites on the Web look horrible and do little to promote actual reading. It amazes me that when pundits talk about the fact that people skim instead of read online that they assume that that can’t change; that it’s a function of being online, when the fact is that the more closed in experience of reading an app or using <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> or <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> demonstrate that there can be a better experience - and that’s not even taking into account the difference between reading these articles on a consumption oriented device, such as an iPad and other innovations we’ve yet to see.</p>

<p>What apps and pay walls do for publishers is segment an audience who want a dedicated, high quality reading experience. Readers who pay three or four hundred dollars a year to subscribe to the print edition of the New York Times are probably not subscribing to a lot of other papers, despite the fact that there have always been hundreds to choose from. We’ve grown accustomed to thinking about content but don’t underestimate the value of convenience and experience. Even if the subscription base has eroded for these companies, there are still millions of dollars of subscriptions out there that need to go somewhere. I’m not saying that revenue/pay issues will be easy to solve or work themselves out in a year, but I do believe that as print disappears the economics will change, the dollars will shift and it’s not safe to say content wants to be free.</p>

<p>That brings us to the Web. As long as Web publishers don’t address the lower quality experience readers get today, their readers will not be loyal (yes, there will be exceptions, particularly the more blog-like publications).</p>

<p><a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-16-at-11.26.43-PM-e1274067139358.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-75" style="border: 4px solid #CCC" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-16-at-11.26.43-PM-e1274067139358.png" alt="" width="450" height="293" /></a></p>

<p>This change needs to come from Editorial and Design. Design can learn from the greater experience, though still in its infancy, of iPad apps and think beyond what’s here and now. For example there are a handful of designers who are publicly musing how to design articles on the Web on a per-article basis, fitting the design to the subject of the article. It’s shouldn’t be inconceivable that we turn those ideas into a reality.</p>

<p>Editorial can learn by treating copy as though it will be on the shelf forever, which it will, and differentiating between blog posts and articles. A recent <a href="http://cjr.org">CJR</a> study showed that magazine publishers do less copy editing on the web and I suspect that there is a technological gap to blame as well as a lack of importance assigned to Web copy. We’ve yet to develop processes for online publishing that work because editorial is forced to be far more technical than in the past.</p>

<p>As print disappears the window of opportunity for born digital publishers will narrow. They’ve been able to find their audience to date - and to be sure, there will always be some segment that will read these creations - but the death of Newsweek isn’t a time for celebration, it’s a time to realize that the shift from print to Web is really happening and competition for eyeballs will become even more intense and we need to think hard about not merely replicating the print experience online, but improving it so that there is nothing lost when the shift ultimately happens.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-pvtn9IXNo&amp;feature=player_embedded">PEN World Voices Festival</a>“Blogs, Twitter, the Kindle: The Future of Reading” was the panel I went to at PEN World Voices Festival (video) that - If you happened to have followed my <a href="http://twitter.com/budparr">twitter</a> stream during the event you know  - I was quite disappointed by the direction it took, primarily because I thought it was a lost opportunity for some really terrific, serious writers to discuss the fate of literary culture in the digital age, as the program promised. From the PEN World Voices Festival <a href="http://www.pen.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/4728/prmID/1986">introduction</a> to the panel:</p>
<blockquote>Philip Roth recently said that reading novels would be a “cultic” activity in 25 years, adding that “the book can’t compete with the screen.” Do other writers share his pessimism? How does the situation differ across cultures and continents—and are there lessons in those differences?</blockquote>
<p>Instead, the discussion dwelled on trivialities like the “Toy Story” (a movie, if for some strange reason you don’t know it) app on the iPad, which in my view has little do with the type of literature everyone on the panel writes and entirely mocks the issue. I highly doubt Roth was being so obvious when he said that. Or… maybe I’m just grumpy, other commenters on the panel weren’t so disappointed.</p>

<p>There were some highlights when panelists talked about their blogging and twitter activity, but even those comments were pretty much dead-on-arrival, and one of the panelists chose not to add anything at all, but instead let us know how sharp his sense of irony is. Definitely the low point of an otherwise terrific festival.</p>

<p>If you want to see some serious discussion of the matter, head upstate next month for the Rochester Institute of Technology’s <a href="http://futureofreading.cias.rit.edu/2010/index.php">“Future of Reading”</a> conference, which I hope <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=2680">Chad Post</a> will be covering in detail.</p>

<p>p.s. My question comes in the 58:30 mark. I asked two questions. The first was whether or not anyone on the panel had read an entire book on an iPad/Kindle/Nook/Sony Reader in the past year. Only one of the panelists said yes, he had.</p>
