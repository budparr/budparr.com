With the addition of collections in Jekyll 2.0 there are a lot of choices one can make about how to structure their site. Besides collections, now you can also add JSON files to the _data directory. I put together this decision tree to help anyone who needs it. This, of course, reflects my own way of thinking about content in a static site generator context, specifically applied to Jekyll. One thing I love about not using a database is that your content is much closer to its original form: documents are documents, data is data. Note that this variety may very well change in the future as collections pages and posts converge toward one content type, likely to be collections with optional features of posts, I'm guessing.
