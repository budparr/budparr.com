Frankly, there’s no way my wife would let me clang away at a typewriter anyway – solitude is hard enough to come by without the click-click-clacking to wake the kid.

I do a lot of writing on a cheap (paper!) notebook and a soft <a href="http://www.staedtler.com/Mars_Lumograph_gb.Staedtler?ActiveID=2213">pencil</a>, but at some point every story begs for the spit and polish of type. That presents some problems for me because I make my living working on the computer, read the paper on the computer, read blogs, and so on and all those things are just a click away, and each of those clicks has many more clicks. You know of what I speak?

<img style="float: right;margin-left: 8px" src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/Screenshot_6.jpg" alt="Tennessee Williams" /> I once <a href="http://chekhovsmistress.com/index.php/article/mac_the_new_typewriter_for_writers/">wrote</a> about Macs being the new typewriter. That’s when I had a Powerbook, which has the smoothest keyboard of any computer known to man. Now I use a MacBook, which is more comfy because it’s smaller and cheaper. The keyboard takes a bit more heft than its double-the-price sibling, but I’ve grown use to it.

But what’s the good of a keyboard if it’s forever leading you away from the glorious path of writing? None, I tell you. I know! So this is what I’ve done:

Macs allow you to set up users. Each user has their own log-in and profile – it’s really very much like being on a separate computer. I set up my alter-ego writer guy profile with parental controls so that I can only access a couple of applications:

1) <a href="http://www.bartastechnologies.com/products/copywrite/">Copywrite</a>

Copywrite is billed as “project management for writers,” which it is, but I can’t say that I use it so elaborately. I primarily use it because it just gives you a blank page with few formatting options, full screen writing, and “versioning,” an invaluable feature because I like to freeze one version (without having to save a new file) before making substantial edits. It does have a lot of other features, like categories, etc. but I don’t use those. I just write with it. I do like having all my documents in front of me if I want to switch what I’m working on, which is an obvious difference between a program like this and, say, that devil’s child, MS Word.

2) Safari Web browser, also with parental controls set so that I can only access one Web site: <a href="http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/">Merriam-Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary</a>

That’s it. I can write. I can look things up in the dictionary, and I can print. I am my own parent and I’ve put myself on restriction. It may seem a little silly, but I even write in a Courier font, which in a way is a reminder that I’m supposed to be writing as though on a typewriter; that means write forward – not writing over what I’ve just written.

p(small). <em>While I’m mentioning writing programs, I should mention that I use <a href="http://www.marinersoftware.com/sitepage.php?page=85">MacJournal</a> for day-to-day writing, such as blog posts or anything else relatively short when I just need to be one second away from creating a new document. Again, the biggest feature here is that there’s no formatting and all your documents are in front of you instead of opening new ones. <a href="http://www.blue-tec.com/ulysses/">Ulysses</a> is another I’ve used, but seems to have too many features for my purposes.</em>
