  <h1 class="page-title">What Web Media Can Learn from Print</h1>
  <p>With the death throes of Newsweek there are a lot of Web publishers wallowing in <a href="http://www.asylum.com/2010/05/07/an-open-letter-to-magazines-from-the-internet/">schadenfreude</a> as the scales are tipping in their direction. What Newsweek has shown is that there’s more to being successful on the Web than being there and even a shift from a weekly print mag to a daily news mag with a “best of” print edition will likely fail too.</p>

<p>Yet, at the same time I see Web media publishers scoff at print media attempts to monetize with pay-walls and dedicated apps, and even readers are up in arms at the prospect of paying for something they’ve gotten used to getting for free.</p>

<p>Firstly, the comments I’ve seen about, for instance, the New York Times’ iPad app, assume that this is a static phenomenon when the fact is that these apps can and will improve quickly and soon will be feature rich and create an incomparable user experience that readers will pay for.</p>

<p>The Web is great, but needs to improve as print readers complete the shift to online. I suspect that there will be a convergence of usability between dedicated apps and Websites, but just as print was slow to get the picture about the web, the web is slow to create a good reading experience.</p>

<p>When you hear someone say they like “holding” a paper in their hands what they really mean is that reading online sucks. It doesn’t have to be that way. The most popular news sites on the Web look horrible and do little to promote actual reading. It amazes me that when pundits talk about the fact that people skim instead of read online that they assume that that can’t change; that it’s a function of being online, when the fact is that the more closed in experience of reading an app or using <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> or <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> demonstrate that there can be a better experience - and that’s not even taking into account the difference between reading these articles on a consumption oriented device, such as an iPad and other innovations we’ve yet to see.</p>

<p>What apps and pay walls do for publishers is segment an audience who want a dedicated, high quality reading experience. Readers who pay three or four hundred dollars a year to subscribe to the print edition of the New York Times are probably not subscribing to a lot of other papers, despite the fact that there have always been hundreds to choose from. We’ve grown accustomed to thinking about content but don’t underestimate the value of convenience and experience. Even if the subscription base has eroded for these companies, there are still millions of dollars of subscriptions out there that need to go somewhere. I’m not saying that revenue/pay issues will be easy to solve or work themselves out in a year, but I do believe that as print disappears the economics will change, the dollars will shift and it’s not safe to say content wants to be free.</p>

<p>That brings us to the Web. As long as Web publishers don’t address the lower quality experience readers get today, their readers will not be loyal (yes, there will be exceptions, particularly the more blog-like publications).</p>

<p><a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-16-at-11.26.43-PM-e1274067139358.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-75" style="border: 4px solid #CCC" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-16-at-11.26.43-PM-e1274067139358.png" alt="" width="450" height="293" /></a></p>

<p>This change needs to come from Editorial and Design. Design can learn from the greater experience, though still in its infancy, of iPad apps and think beyond what’s here and now. For example there are a handful of designers who are publicly musing how to design articles on the Web on a per-article basis, fitting the design to the subject of the article. It’s shouldn’t be inconceivable that we turn those ideas into a reality.</p>

<p>Editorial can learn by treating copy as though it will be on the shelf forever, which it will, and differentiating between blog posts and articles. A recent <a href="http://cjr.org">CJR</a> study showed that magazine publishers do less copy editing on the web and I suspect that there is a technological gap to blame as well as a lack of importance assigned to Web copy. We’ve yet to develop processes for online publishing that work because editorial is forced to be far more technical than in the past.</p>

<p>As print disappears the window of opportunity for born digital publishers will narrow. They’ve been able to find their audience to date - and to be sure, there will always be some segment that will read these creations - but the death of Newsweek isn’t a time for celebration, it’s a time to realize that the shift from print to Web is really happening and competition for eyeballs will become even more intense and we need to think hard about not merely replicating the print experience online, but improving it so that there is nothing lost when the shift ultimately happens.</p>
