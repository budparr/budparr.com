  <div class="entry-content prose">
    <p>Back in 2010 I wrote a post here called &ldquo;<a title="Making Ebooks is as Easy as Blogging: My Instapaper(book) on Paul Muldoon" href="http://ageofsand.budparr.com/Book Futurism/making-ebooks-is-as-easy-as-blogging/">Making Ebooks is as Easy as Blogging: My Instapaper(book) on Paul Muldoon</a>&rdquo; that outlined a fairly easy process of putting together an e-book by collecting pieces from around the internet and adding them to my Instapaper account.</p>

<p><a title="Instapaper" href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> has a feature to download your saved articles to epub/Kindle. I just took my collected articles and an introduction from a blog post I made on my Tumblr account and voila! a book.</p>

<p>Of course, I assumed that I was breaking some copyright laws by doing this, but it was an experiment only and I had no intention of distributing it any way.</p>

<p>To my mind, this sort of thing would soon become normal and perhaps obviate the publishing tradition of packaging a writer&rsquo;s past essays and releasing them as a book. If such a collection&rsquo;s value to a reader is in selection and packaging, that&rsquo;s something that can easily be taken on by the reader (the new breed of &ldquo;Curator&rdquo;) if the articles were available. And why shouldn&rsquo;t they be?</p>

<p>Fast forward to today (well, a few months ago), and a service similar to Instapaper, called <a title="Readability" href="http://readability.com">Readability</a>, has institutionalized that process with a service called &ldquo;<a title="Readlists" href="http://readlists.com/">Readlists</a>,&rdquo; which some have likened to text &ldquo;mix-tapes&rdquo; for sharing a particular mix of articles on the web. This has caused a bit of a <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/readlists-debate-ebook-repackaging-splits-industry">kerfuffle</a>, apparently, between the two services over whether or not this is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>The salient point of the argument is this, according to the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/readlists-debate-ebook-repackaging-splits-industry">.net</a>&rdquo; article:
<blockquote>He [Marco Arment, developer of Instapaper] said his &lsquo;read it later&rsquo; service Instapaper is justified through fair-use doctrine (in a similar way to how television can be legally time-shifted through using a PVR or VCR), but Readlists takes things too far: &ldquo;That service&rsquo;s mass redistribution of copyrighted content through public ebook-format downloads is definitely not fair use. Readlists crosses a significant line that Instapaper will not.&rdquo;</blockquote>
I&rsquo;m not qualified to say if he&rsquo;s right, but I think there&rsquo;s a certain inevitability in this sort of disintermediation. There&rsquo;s a huge wave of &ldquo;curating&rdquo; going on now with all the social sharing sites; Readlists is in some ways a smart (my bias) version of a Pinterest board, is it not?</p>

<p>Earlier this year I decided to begin using Wordpress for some of my development work. I dove in to as much information I could find - there&rsquo;s a wealth of it - on the web. But I like the thought and order of a book. Among the fairly good and pretty good books I found were <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/ebooks/?pk_campaign=smashing-magazine-ebooks-tab">Smashing Magazine&rsquo;s</a> collection of Wordpress articles from their site. I believe (I haven&rsquo;t verified this) that all the articles were available online, but for $5, I was happy to pay for their collecting them for me. Of course they originally published the articles so here there were no copyright issues, but the point is that form matters and the hyper hypertext of the web can sometimes use some context. I also created my own collection of articles in Evernote.</p>

<p>The New York Times published a collection of their web content on the Wikileaks episode, called &ldquo;<a title="Open Secrets" href="http://www.nytimes.com/opensecrets/">Open Secrets</a>.&rdquo; They added more content to their collection than what they had originally published, but there&rsquo;s no reason that someone else couldn&rsquo;t have made a similar collection and perhaps added other sources.</p>

<p>I was in a bar last week that was playing music from Spotify, a (great) music subscription service. As far as I can tell from reviewing Spotify&rsquo;s terms, that sort of ostensibly commercial use is a violation. <a href="http://www.bmi.com/">BMI</a>, the music rights management firm, actually sends agents out to inspect establishments to enforce musicians&#39; rights. That seems pretty daunting and expensive. Fortunately for copyright holders on the web there are &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot">bots</a>&rdquo; to do the same job.</p>

<p>Whether or not it confounds owners of content, readers are quickly becoming accustomed to reading when and where they want and putting together content that makes sense to them. Reader as curator. I don&rsquo;t think that will stop professional curators (publishers and editors) or writers packaging their own work just as they always have. The value of the act is still there, but if you expect to put a price on it, it&rsquo;s going to have to be good.</p>
