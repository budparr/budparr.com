  <div class="entry-content prose">

    
    <p><a href="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/Internet_dog_pub-268x3001.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-949" src="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/Internet_dog_pub-268x3001.jpg" alt="On the internet nobody knows you're not a publisher" width="268" height="300" /></a>In the not-distant future, the idea of a book or magazine will be much more fluid than it is today, partly because they are easier to produce than in the past, and partly because we will come to expect them to be different.</p>

<p><strong>Repackaging Content</strong></p>

<p>One wonders how many of the hundreds of thousands of books published every year are collections of work already published, such as stories or essays. What is the value in repackaging previously published material? Sometimes, like the case with short stories, they are inaccessible in their original form because they were published in many different journals of varying levels of availability. Also, putting a collection together gives the individual pieces some needed context or force of argument, as is the case with Alex Ross’s collection of essays, <em>Listen to This</em>, bringing together Ross’s <em>New Yorker</em> articles that, so far as I can tell, aim specifically to bridge a gap between popular and classical music (there is one previously unpublished essay in the book). For a long time now professors have pulled together “books” of a variety of material for their students, and today you can put your own “book” together of Wikipedia articles with the click of a button (in PDF, OpenDocument Text, or Print-on-demand).</p>

<p><strong>Reading Content Outside of its Original Home</strong></p>

<p>We’ve become promiscuous with our nonfiction reading. Atomization began with RSS readers, which display content by date or topic, rather than just the source. Then, the swift change in the media environment drew lines (then blurred them) between writers and their publications. Now we read based on the recommendation of twitterers and “friends” rather than sitting down to our morning paper. Our sources might be chosen for a variety of reasons, not just the veneration of the package they came in. Apps like <a href="http://www.flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>, will further challenge our old reading habits. Interestingly, Instapaper - the online application that allows you to save articles to read later on your own device instead of its published source - gives publishers guidelines if they want their content to look its best through their service.</p>

<p><strong>Contexts Can Change</strong></p>

<p>The point is that content takes on meaning  depending on how it is packaged and consumed, and no one publication will have a monopoly on either. In the same way that I know people because of common interest rather than physical proximity (primarily because of my online activities), I read not - necessarily - based on publication, but on interest. I may sit one night and read articles and blog posts on publishing, then read about technology, or literature from other sets of sources.</p>

<p><strong>Crowd-Curation</strong></p>

<p>With the growing popularity of microblogs like <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and <a href="http://posterous.com">Posterous</a>, we all become curators as well as consumers. While a microblog may be an on-the-fly mechanism, we’re also seeing an interest in long-form writing (crowd-curated by sites like <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/browse">Instapaper</a> and <a href="http://longreads.com/">Longreads</a>). There’s no reason why that won’t turn into something more thoughtful where a body of essays or stories (perhaps collected from a site like <a href="http://www.fictionaut.com/">Fictionaut</a>) are curated and shared by anyone with the knowledge or time to assemble them. There will be issues, to be sure. Rights and the potential to manipulate content are just a couple to reckon with.</p>

<p>I’ve been fooling around with this idea in my head a bit. Books (or, broadly, publications) in any form are a vessel to focus our attention and to have some semblance of permanence, even if, as in the above examples, that is merely a matter of convenience or editorial choice. That much won’t change. What will change is the necessity for content to be emitted straight from a publisher’s hand to its final destination.</p>

<p><strong>One Example</strong></p>

<p>To the end of thinking about this in practical, if somewhat crude, terms, I created an ebook of related articles. I use <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> to collect articles and it’s become my preferred environment for reading on the iPad, even though what I really enjoy is the book-like environment of reading in an ereader, like iBooks. Instapaper has a feature on its website that allows you to create an EPUB (among other formats) of your content. By putting articles into a folder you can create a specific theme or whatever grouping you like of articles. Instapaper isn’t meant to create books, necessarily, so this is a bit rough, and just for fun anyway; it’s a bit wanting for formatting. Naturally, I didn’t secure any reprint rights for the content, though everything is sourced and linked to from the book. It’s not for sale and for private use only and will be linked to from here unless someone gets angry and wants me to take it down.</p>

<p><strong>A Good Subject</strong></p>

<p>I chose Paul Muldoon because while reading his latest collection Maggot, I also wanted to read The Paris Review interview of him, thinking that I’d like to read it on my iPad so I can get to it on the train. So, despite having the original print version, I went to The Paris Review website, saved it to Instapaper, then thought I’d put together some other pieces to draw a more complete picture.</p>

<p>The articles in this collection begin with Muldoon’s Wikipedia entry, several biographical articles, reviews and interviews, culminating in The Paris Review interview from 2004. There’s no poetry in the book because I fear formatting could easily be screwed up (see my previous <a href="http://ageofsand.com/2010/10/can-we-trust-poetry-ebooks-the-case-of-allen-ginsbergs-collected-poems/">post</a> on poetry formatting in EPUB).</p>

<p>So here it is, [<a href="http://ageofsand.com/documents/Instapaper(book) - Introduction to Paul Muldoon.epub.zip">An Introduction to Paul Muldoon</a>].</p>
