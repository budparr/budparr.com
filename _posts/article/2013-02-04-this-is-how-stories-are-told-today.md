I've often thought that if I were going to an MFA writing program I'd also study filmmaking. It's not that I don't value text - I do, wholeheartedly. But, there are a lot of stories, not necessarily feature films, that can be told as well or better with video. The famous/infamous critic Leslie Fiedler said that a masterpiece is a work that transcends its medium. His prime example was "Gone with the Wind."

Here's a perfect example for a short story being told with video. This short is based off of a story by Etgar Keret, a favorite writer of mine. His style of writing is well suited to this transcendence because he has a way of honing what he wants to the point of brilliant concision.

This short was played at the Sundance Film Festival, and it's terrific:
