  <p>We recently watched the documentary “<a href="http://www.notebynotethemovie.com/">Note by Note: The Making of Steinway L1037</a>” and the whole family enjoyed it. I only wanted to see it because I love music and the mystique that instruments hold, but I wasn’t really expecting what the story was really about: Craftsmanship, painstaking, minute, detailed craftsmanship.</p>

<p>The film follows a Steinway concert grand over the course of the year it takes to make it, from the forest trees where its wood comes from, to the factory in Queens where its created, to its place on the Steinway showroom where pianists will first develop their relationship with it. Over the course of the journey the film is dominated by interviews with the piano’s makers as well as some well known musicians who use Steinways. This juxtaposition of the makers and users is really the crux of the film. Both are lovingly dedicated to their art to a rarified degree, but aside from their passion what’s remarkable is the cause and effect the filmmakers draw out. The sixteenth of an inch cut or quality of a particular sheet of wood, the tolerances and exactitude of the placement of each key, these factors emerge as a piano’s personality through its creation. The musicians respond with great affection to one piano or another, as in one scene followed Pierre-Laurent Aimard looking for a “monster.”</p>

<p>A subtext of the film is that this sort of craftsmanship is dying. Where once their were hundreds of piano makers, now there are few, and there seemed to be some question of finding people in the future who might be willing to do this sort of work. Fortunately the film didn’t dwell there at all and instead celebrated the magnificence of these instruments.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, we just bought an electric piano for our family. It’s a very nice piano (not a keyboard, but a full-fledged piano) and it probably sounds as good as any spinet we could afford (seriously, it sounds great). What it might lack in elegance and beauty it makes up for in utility in a family of five where three boys will be going through piano lessons, banging away at the keyboard for years to come. We can play it as though it’s an organ or piano, and if we wished any number of other configurations. My wife is an avid pianist and she loves that she can turn the volume down and play at night, or put on headphones, which make it sound even better.</p>

<p>Yeah, there’s a sense of technology trumping craftsmanship. The ambivalence I feel about such matters - the fear of loss of things made with love, while at the same time enjoying the enabling affect of technology, is something that I hope never goes away.</p>

<p>Here’s a clip from the film:</p>
