        A Note on Howl, the Movie
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Oct 2010</span>

    <p><strong>A movie about a poem? Really? How does that work?</strong></p>

<p>Well, it helps if the poem was famous, and great, and had its own obscenity trial. It’s a nice reminder of how great the poem is, particularly when read aloud, and particularly in the face of the fact that there are still lots of places in this country where books are banned.</p>

<p><strong>But is it good? </strong></p>

<p>I went during the day to spare my wife having to sit through a movie about a poem. I was on my own and nearly walked out of the theater several times.</p>

<p><strong>So it’s bad?</strong></p>

<p>Not exactly. <a href="http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/film/89268/howl-film-review">Time Out New York</a> panned it. That’s too bad. They panned James Franco’s reading too, saying he “did little more than mimic Ginsberg’s squeaky tenor cadences,” calling him “too hipster-primped by half.”</p>

<p>I thought Franco’s reading was very good, the highlight of the film, along with the interview scenes  (based on actual records). Maybe the Time Out  reviewer is an expert, I don’t know, but I’ve read the poem myself, aloud, and I’ve listened to it read by Ginsberg what seems like a million times. The early recording [<a href="http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Ginsberg/SFSU-1956/Ginsberg-Allen_04_Howl_SFSU_10-25-56.mp3">link</a>] of Ginsberg reading it isn’t great, but he does build momentum (and, seemingly, confidence) as he goes on, just as Franco did. A later recording, which is set to Lee Hyla’s string quartet, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000005J3N/qid=1077325102/sr=1-13/ref=sr_1_13/102-6487001-3036120?v=glance&amp;s=classical">Howl,</a>” and recorded in, I think, 1994, is a more mature Ginsberg when he really had come into himself as a reader. It’s a great great reading. There’s a stark difference between the two. Franco’s reading is set when Ginsberg had just recently written it. His performance seems not only <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2010/09/james-franco-howl-aurally.html">accurate</a>, but to some degree transporting and enjoyable.</p>

<p>The trial segment was “good” (Don Draper playing John Hamm, playing Ferlinghetti’s attorney, Jake Ehrlich) and the flashback scenes were  ”okay” (I’m assuming that if you’re reading this, you’ve at least seen summaries or the film itself). The weaving of these elements I think was, nonetheless, a brilliant way to present the poem in film, largely letting it (and the record) speak for itself.</p>

<p><strong>So, what’s bad enough that you’d want to walk out?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://ginsbergblog.blogspot.com/">Allen Ginsberg Project </a>calls the animation scenes “underappreciated.” I think they’re just an abomination. Granted, in any other context they’d be considered artful and accomplished, but I agree with A.O. Scott in the <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/movies/24howl.html?pagewanted=all">NY Times</a>, who said…</p>
<blockquote>It is as if an earnest, literal-minded undergraduate had set out to illustrate “Howl” without understanding the essential difference between poetic and pictorial imagery, a distinction that was hardly lost on Ginsberg, a gifted photographer who counted William Blake among his crucial influences.</blockquote>
<p>They were utterly distracting, so much so I wanted to hide my eyes, or worse, just leave the theater. They were jolting as though an ad or different movie had come on suddenly, and of course, they were insulting to the poem.</p>

<p>Watch the trailer below. There’s probably a reason you don’t see the animations much. Maybe one day there will be a <em>people’s</em> cut with a blank screen over those scenes.</p>

<p>Also see the “<a href="http://ginsbergblog.blogspot.com/">Allen Ginsberg Project</a>” blog for links to a host of other opinions. <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/HowlTheMovie">Levi likes the animations</a>.</p>

        Will Magazine iPad Apps Go the Way of the 8-track?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2010</span>

    <p><a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0009.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-364" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0009-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Love the new <em>New Yorker</em> iPad app. If I could have it as a subscription like I have for the print version (which I think I pay $25/yr for), I would certainly buy it, knowing that I’d never have to rip out another article to stick in my pocket as I run out of the house, and confident that I’d never wonder where ‘that’ article was I started a week ago and couldn’t find. Digital trumps print hands down for periodicals.</p>

<p><em>The New Yorker</em> app, like most all the magazine apps available now, is visually appealing. The ads are attractive yet not terribly distracting. The navigation is infinitely better than print, as well as the integrated video or audio content.</p>

<p>Yet, stepping back, magazine publishers are falling well short of the promise of the magical device they’re publishing on.</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_366” align=”alignright” width=”225” caption=”National Geographic iPad app image broken up”]<a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0007.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-366" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0007-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Something’s missing. Dynamism, to start. A replica of a printed magazine doesn’t feel very dynamic because it’s not. In fact, it appears to be only a step above Zinio magazines (whom, I assure you, if they don’t innovate, will be in the graveyard soon because they really are nothing more than a replica of a print magazine and no better than a pdf file).</p>

<p>That ain’t going to cut it.</p>

<p>I don’t want to be a complainer. Really. If there were a good subscription model for <em>The New Yorker</em> iPad app, I would subscribe and bide time until it got better. I’d much rather read digital than print (on a dedicated device, that is, not a laptop) and I think everyone will in fairly short order as tablets and e-readers continue their march into the mainstream.</p>

<p>Yet, the fanfare of the common magazine app signals a march into digital with little more than lip service to the great potential for magazines. Here are a few observations:</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_368” align=”alignleft” width=”225” caption=”The New Yorker app full page navigation”]<a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0004.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-368" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0004-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>1) Navigation is all over the place right now.  Some apps swipe right to left to go to a new page in an article - like a print magazine - and some scroll down - like a Website. Navigation from article to article is either a swipe or a tap  or a scroll to find other articles. The full page navigation is marginally helpful.</p>

<p>Here’s where apps can learn from print. All print magazines I know of are consistent in the way one turns a page: a ‘swipe’. It’s nice not to confound expectations.</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_374” align=”alignright” width=”225” caption=”MacLife app (with navigation drawer open) has small print that's not zoomable.”]<a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0008.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-374" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0008-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>2) What e-pub (<a href="http://ageofsand.com/2010/06/vqr-is-the-smartest-magazine-on-the-planet-and-has-embraced-the-future-of-magazines/">my favorite format for magazines</a>) does so nicely is to let readers determine their own optimal text size. Images of magazines in an app are static and you can’t even zoom in on them like you can with a web page on an iPad. Some are not bad. The New Yorker is readable despite choosing an unfriendly typeface in hopes - I suppose - of making long-time subscribers feel comfortable. But, the <em>MacLife</em> app (which also forgets your place when you leave the app, <em>grrr</em>) has small type.</p>

<p>The <em>National Geographic</em> app (powered by Zinio) is a hybrid in this regard. While flipping through the replica of the magazine, you are instructed to tap on a button to read the text. Doing so, you are given a text only version of the article (tada! flexible font-sizes). I’ve been reading <em>National Geographic</em> off and on since I was a kid. I would never. I mean NEVER have read text-only versions of their articles. Photographs are the heart of the magazine, and to separate the two because you know your replica of a magazine is unreadable otherwise is an inexcusable failure.</p>

<p><em>Gourmet Magazine’s</em> app, <em>Gourmet Live</em>, which I think is a hybrid, web-based app, does allow for font-size changes, though it’s overall article design is linear, blog post-like and generally poor.</p>

<p>3) Magazines in the digital age should publish on a continuum. Like the feeds of blogs (and magazines) I read in my feed-reader, I want new articles to magically appear in my reading device (in real-time). In fact, I don’t think magazines should publish issues at all. While some magazines, like <em>Current History</em>, publish thematically, many are merely time-based, like <em>The New Yorker</em>, and must realize that an “issue” is a term that should be filed away with “print.”</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_370” align=”alignleft” width=”150” caption=”I won! A related article I get for completing (scrolling through, at least) the last article. “]<a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0005.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-370" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0005-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Streams of articles can be published when they are ready. The New Yorker already has follow up blog posts to articles on their website. In the app, those posts should be part of the article, as well as pertinent metadata.</p>

<p>I want to see magazines pull in related concepts or articles. The <em>Gourmet Live</em> app does this, though I don’t care for the “game” aspect, or the fact that I can’t do anything with it until I’ve registered (the social-media centric kids who must have designed the app assume that everyone using it <em>must</em> surely have a Facebook or Twitter account to log in with, creating yet one more barrier to using their product). However, I really admire the concept of actively involving users, though I think - as unsexy as it sounds - a table of related articles or a way to save articles in an iTunes-like format might be more helpful. I do think the <em>Gourmet Live</em> app is the smartest I’ve seen and one to watch for how it improves over time.</p>

<p>So yeah, this is a bit of a rant - constructive, hopefully - but I think it’s worth questioning if “apps” are even the right medium for magazines. Apps can be ported from device to device, but without a standard format your magazine is that much more likely to disappear as devices come and go. Epub is a standard, it’s flexible and accessible on a wide variety of devices. I think more energy should be put into making good magazines in a format that allows for dynamism and fluidity, and can fit into a library or some file system, and skip the sexy features. Publishers should think in terms of all the ways each and every piece of content can be distributed instead shoehorning old concepts into hot new devices. Don’t let the tail (devices) wag the dog, as they say.</p>

        Obama, Dylan

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Sep 2010</span>

    <p>I just love this, particularly since I remember hearing that Dylan was playing at the White House and thinking to myself, what the hell is Bob Dylan doing at the White House? This is President Obama talking about that event with The Rolling Stone:</p>
<blockquote>Here's what I love about Dylan: He was exactly as you'd expect he would be. He wouldn't come to the rehearsal; usually, all these guys are practicing before the set in the evening. He didn't want to take a picture with me; usually all the talent is dying to take a picture with me and Michelle before the show, but he didn't show up to that. He came in and played "The Times They Are A-Changin'." A beautiful rendition. The guy is so steeped in this stuff that he can just come up with some new arrangement, and the song sounds completely different. Finishes the song, steps off the stage — I'm sitting right in the front row — comes up, shakes my hand, sort of tips his head, gives me just a little grin, and then leaves. And that was it — then he left. That was our only interaction with him. And I thought: That's how you want Bob Dylan, right? You don't want him to be all cheesin' and grinnin' with you. You want him to be a little skeptical about the whole enterprise. So that was a real treat.</blockquote>

        Craftsmanship
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2010</span>

    <p>We recently watched the documentary “<a href="http://www.notebynotethemovie.com/">Note by Note: The Making of Steinway L1037</a>” and the whole family enjoyed it. I only wanted to see it because I love music and the mystique that instruments hold, but I wasn’t really expecting what the story was really about: Craftsmanship, painstaking, minute, detailed craftsmanship.</p>

<p>The film follows a Steinway concert grand over the course of the year it takes to make it, from the forest trees where its wood comes from, to the factory in Queens where its created, to its place on the Steinway showroom where pianists will first develop their relationship with it. Over the course of the journey the film is dominated by interviews with the piano’s makers as well as some well known musicians who use Steinways. This juxtaposition of the makers and users is really the crux of the film. Both are lovingly dedicated to their art to a rarified degree, but aside from their passion what’s remarkable is the cause and effect the filmmakers draw out. The sixteenth of an inch cut or quality of a particular sheet of wood, the tolerances and exactitude of the placement of each key, these factors emerge as a piano’s personality through its creation. The musicians respond with great affection to one piano or another, as in one scene followed Pierre-Laurent Aimard looking for a “monster.”</p>

<p>A subtext of the film is that this sort of craftsmanship is dying. Where once their were hundreds of piano makers, now there are few, and there seemed to be some question of finding people in the future who might be willing to do this sort of work. Fortunately the film didn’t dwell there at all and instead celebrated the magnificence of these instruments.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, we just bought an electric piano for our family. It’s a very nice piano (not a keyboard, but a full-fledged piano) and it probably sounds as good as any spinet we could afford (seriously, it sounds great). What it might lack in elegance and beauty it makes up for in utility in a family of five where three boys will be going through piano lessons, banging away at the keyboard for years to come. We can play it as though it’s an organ or piano, and if we wished any number of other configurations. My wife is an avid pianist and she loves that she can turn the volume down and play at night, or put on headphones, which make it sound even better.</p>

<p>Yeah, there’s a sense of technology trumping craftsmanship. The ambivalence I feel about such matters - the fear of loss of things made with love, while at the same time enjoying the enabling affect of technology, is something that I hope never goes away.</p>

<p>Here’s a clip from the film:</p>
