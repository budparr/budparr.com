FINALLY. Vacation. Long overdue and a chance to catch up on some reading. Here's what I'm taking to the beach:

*The Guy Davenport Reader*. I've read _Geographies of the Imagination_ and *A Table of Green Fields*, which is incomprehensibly wonderful,  so this looks like an irresistible collection.

*Hypothermia*, by Álvaro Enrigue. I've been waiting a long time for this collection, since reading Enrigue's [*On the Death of the Author*](http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/on-the-death-of-the-author) at Words Without Borders.

*Hawthorne & Child*, by Keith Ridgway. I'm going in blind on this. The publisher (my client) is enthusiastic about it and there's a blurb by Zadie Smith that says it's "idiosyncratic" and another blurb that says that it's "unpredictable." Sounds good to me.

*The Infatuations*, by Javier Marías. I often say that I never recommend Marías to anyone because you have to have a special patience for his writing (e.g. five minute scenes stretching out 80 pages or more), but I love his work, having read the *Your Face Tomorrow* trilogy and several other works of his (*A Heart So White* being another fave).

I think that's it. I've been perusing a few things to take along but haven't settled on anything. I wish there were a Bolaño I haven't read. I'll also be finishing up *The Lord of the Rings*, which I've been reading with my son this year, though I have to take it slow because he gets upset if I get ahead of him, and he too is a grazer. I used to read a Shakespeare play every summer, but I think I have enough on my plate and it always makes me talk funny.

As you can tell, I'm not a pulp beach reader. Vacation is one of the few times I can immerse myself in a bit of reading these days, so I hate to waste that time.
