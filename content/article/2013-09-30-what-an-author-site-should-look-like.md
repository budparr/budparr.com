I wrote a piece called [*What an Author Site Should Look Like*](https://medium.com/lessons-learned/1747b9766f59) and published it on the new publishing platform Medium. You can read it there, but here's an excerpt: 

> Nobody Cares About You
> 
> This goes for any website. Readers don’t spend a lot of time on any website and they click very little. Blogs and about pages are often draws, but that’s it. Any website should do as little as possible and be about the person visiting it, not an overdesigned marketing-copy-ladened beast.
