The movie "Nine" is based on a play that is in turn based on the film "8 1/2." Despite an all-star cast led by Daniel Day-Lewis and a stunningly beautiful production it manages to fall flat on its face. If one wanted a film example of <a href="http://www.robkapilow.com/wmigreat.shtml">"What Makes it Great"</a> with a bastard interpretation of an earlier great work, this is it. "Nine" is a perfectly soulless film. Avoid except for medicinal purposes.

But one good thing came of an otherwise wasted evening. While searching around to see if I was the only one who loathed "Nine," I found <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091223/REVIEWS/912239996">Roger Ebert's</a> review and learned this bit that I missed by not going to film school (or, whatever):
<blockquote>Fellini's great films are essentially musicals. Like most Italian directors of his generation, he didn't record live dialogue and sound. He depended on dubbing. On a set, he usually had an orchestra playing, and asked his actors to move, not in time with the music, but "in sympathy." Everyone in a Fellini film evokes an inner body rhythm. Then there's Rota's music itself, my favorite soundtracks. I could watch a Fellini film on the radio.</blockquote>
That makes perfect sense now that I know it, and nowhere would the concept be more clear than in "8 1/2."
