xwuWQTeDRriYcdgfJ3AqVhXjapk4MmKB is an example of what one of my passwords looks like. I also use Google's double authentification (which is a royal pain) for my gmail and work email accounts, and each of my passwords to public sites is different.

DO THIS.

I, obviously, use a password manager. There are other ways, but if you are still hanging on to your dog/kid password or something else that seems unique to you but really isn't it is time to change your ways. Nate Silver says you have a 92% chance of getting hacked*.
