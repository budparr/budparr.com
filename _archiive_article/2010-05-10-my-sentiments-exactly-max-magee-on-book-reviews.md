<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<div class="im">This is the sort of thing the Web does well. Max is a great editor who created his own site and quietly shakes things up by not just going along with the traditional idea of the book review. Instead of sitting back and complaining about the New York Times Book Review, he puts his ideas into practice:</div>
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">
<div class="im">To be honest, I'm not a big fan of book reviews, generally. We have some writers who are exceptional at writing book reviews, and I would happily read their thoughts on every book they pick up. However, I think the traditional newspaper book review can be rather boring.</div>
When a review comes across my desk, I often haven't read the book in question (I can only read so much) and I may not be particularly interested in reading the book, but if I am still nonetheless interested in reading the review on its own terms, then the review is a success. Many, many book reviews, from those in newspapers to those on the lowliest website, do not pass this test.

I don't mean to say that we don't publish the occasional straight-ahead review––we do––but whenever possible, I like to bring something stylistically fresh to the table so that every reader who comes across the review has the potential to be engaged by it, whether or not they were interested in the book at hand.</blockquote>
