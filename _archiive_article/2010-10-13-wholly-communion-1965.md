I just saw this video posted by <a href="http://www.citylights.com/">City Lights</a> on Facebook of a 1965 reading at Royal Albert Hall with 19 poets including Allen Ginsberg, who I think organized the event, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Andrei Voznesenski, Harry Fainlight, Ernst Jandl, William Burroughs, and Christopher Logue. It'sÂ such a fantastic video if for nothing else the energy in the room. I've been to poetry readings in large halls with at least a couple thousand people, but this is more like a rock concert of poetry - there were reportedly 7,000 people there with the audience an active participant. Aside from some of the antics, my favorite reading is from Christopher Logue. Here's an excerpt on Youtube and somebody posted a longer one on MySpace (but I can't seem to embed that, but you should definitely click through and watch it all).
