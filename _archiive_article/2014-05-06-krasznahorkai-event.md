I wrote a brief piece on seeing Colm Tóibín interview László Krasznahorkai at a PEN World Voices Festival event. It was a truly fascinating conversation. Here's an excerpt:

>I found one of the most interesting facts about Mr. Krasznahorkai is the way he combines his love of travel (or more likely, love of being in different places) with his love of music.

That insatiable curiousity and desire for empathy seem to me to be the hallmark of a great writer, living a life of curiosity rather than some notion of a writer's life.
