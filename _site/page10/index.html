        My sentiments exactly: Max Magee on Book Reviews
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 May 2010</span>

    <div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<div class="im">This is the sort of thing the Web does well. Max is a great editor who created his own site and quietly shakes things up by not just going along with the traditional idea of the book review. Instead of sitting back and complaining about the New York Times Book Review, he puts his ideas into practice:</div>
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">
<div class="im">To be honest, I'm not a big fan of book reviews, generally. We have some writers who are exceptional at writing book reviews, and I would happily read their thoughts on every book they pick up. However, I think the traditional newspaper book review can be rather boring.</div>
When a review comes across my desk, I often haven't read the book in question (I can only read so much) and I may not be particularly interested in reading the book, but if I am still nonetheless interested in reading the review on its own terms, then the review is a success. Many, many book reviews, from those in newspapers to those on the lowliest website, do not pass this test.

I don't mean to say that we don't publish the occasional straight-ahead review––we do––but whenever possible, I like to bring something stylistically fresh to the table so that every reader who comes across the review has the potential to be engaged by it, whether or not they were interested in the book at hand.</blockquote>

        When Google Dominates the Way We (Find, Buy) Read E-books
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 May 2010</span>

    <p>This morning Google announced - re-announced - that they will launch their foray into e-book selling as soon as this summer. Chris Palma, Google’s head of Strategic Partner Development, spoke this morning at the offices of Random House as part of panel discussion hosted by Publishers Weekly on the future of book publishing.</p>

<p>This is an idea Google has let percolate for quite a while, Palma said, but only now with the proliferation of devices and major players do they feel it is finally the right time to throw their hat into the e-book ring.</p>
<p>Google Editions will build upon Google's existing Book Search product: <a href="http://books.google.com/">http://books.google.com/</a> Search and access books just the way you do now, only soon you'll be able to buy your books directly from Google (or via an Online retailer - Powell's was the example used) and add them to your google (Gmail) account for reading on any device.</p>
<p>Google's mantra is buy anywhere, read anywhere. That also is what most of the e-book players say, but Google means it. They see their audience not as the millions of people who have bought Kindles or iPads, but the entire universe of 1.8 billion internet users and Google's reader will simply be a Web browser.</p>
<p>Their books will exist solely in "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">the cloud</a>," which may have some interesting implications: namely, there's no file to download. When you read a Google e-book, you are reading a cached file online (yes, you will have offline access thanks to the newest version of HTML 5).</p>
<p>And if there's no file to download, there's no file to share or steal. Palma made the point that if a user wanted to share a Google e-book they'd have to share their entire Google account, which could include Gmail, your Web history, and so forth, with the reasoning that few are likely to do this. This may or may not be foolproof though Palma indicated that even if a hacker got into an account they'd be accessing one book only without the ability to do any pirating.</p>
<p>This setup also may also be an answer to Digital Rights Management issues. I wonder - the question wasn't broached - if their method would lead to the possibility of a user relinquishing their right to a book and turning that right over to someone else, for a limited time or permanently. This seems possible because there's no file to replicate, but remains to be seen or even discussed, to my knowledge. I do think the ability to share will sooner or later be a matter of consumer demand.</p>
<p>While Palma touted the ability for readers to search across their entire library or to share their margin notes with friends or any buyer of the same book, one of the audience wondered how the search function will affect which books get exposure. The answer of course, as it always is with Google, is relevance, leaving a gaping question about which books get sold. Thinking about how Google search works, it would seem that the latest edition would get the most exposure at any given time, completely independent of each version's relative merits.</p>
<p>
<p>Much of today's discussion was industry focused and centered around the three major players: Google, Amazon, and Apple. One panelist, <a href="http://www.blackplasticglasses.com">Evan Schnittman</a> from Oxford University Press, went into the relative strengths and weaknesses of each and the various models they operated under.</p>
<p>Google's approach of using an HTML, browser-based reader (books will be in e-pub format) may leave a lot desired for a lot of readers as it's been my experience so far that apps are nicer, generally speaking. Google's focus is on the less exciting aspects of e-books - search and annotation, rather than the reading experience - which might limit their impact to certain types of books, though just how the reader will perform remains to be seen.</p>
<p>It seems to me from listening to this panel that this is Amazon's game to lose, and with over a million iPads out in the wild in the first month alone, both Google and Apple, despite their differences, about which Palma made some vague references, will drive the e-book market in the future. Well, we'll see, but that was how I came away feeling from today's talk.</p>
<p>The entire discussion was taped by C-Span, so may be available on their Website soon.</p>

        It's the End of Free As We Thought We Knew It
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2010</span>

    <p>When I worked on Wall Street the common wisdom was “fade the press” meaning that when Time and Newsweek, etc all led with stories of doom for the economy then it was time buy. This was an old and well worn principle, yet not one to ignore.</p>

<p>Could it be that within ten months of when “Wired Magazine’s” Chris Anderson published his book <em>Free: The Future of a Radical Price</em> that the pendulum is swinging? There’s much debate over whether or not old media establishments will survive charging for content (the iPad will not save them, the mantra goes) because “content wants to be free.”</p>

<p>Lots of people outside of media, including Marc Andreessen, the founder of Netscape - which was a great thing to create but is notably no longer in existence - say old media is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/06/andreessen-media-burn-boats/">“shortsighted at best”</a> trying to charge money for content.</p>

<p>Yet, Andreessen’s Ning network - another great thing whose story is not yet final - just announced that they are no longer free. And what’s more, they are, according to this <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/15/nings-bubble-bursts-no-more-free-networks-cuts-40-of-staff/">TechCrunch article</a>, kicking out all their previously existing free networks unless they start paying. That seems like a drastic and shortsighted move to me.</p>

<p>The ever-brilliant <a href="http://37signals.com/">37 Signals</a> gang doesn’t believe in “free” as a business concept, but they’ve always offered a free version of their applications (indeed, the ability to move back and forth between free and paid versions as conditions warrant is what has kept me as a customer all these years).</p>

<p>The blog Gigaom has a relatively new and terrific paid site, <a href="http://pro.gigaom.com/">Gigaom Pro</a>, for more advanced research, Twitter is desperately trying to monetize without charging directly (a plan which I seem to be the only one who will think fail)</p>

<p>And truth is, I love reading some newspapers in the iPad app version and would pay for it if it were really well designed so as to give me control over how I consume the paper. Yes, it’s true there’s tons of great content on the Web, but even the best designed Web-based papers have lots and lots of noise (ads and links everywhere) and do a pretty poor job of taking into account what I may have read already, what sections I tend to read, what stories I’m following, etc. (though solving these issues may or may not be a Web vs app question).</p>

<p>I think that while content in general tends toward free there is room for the right content presented well that is worth paying for; no one has found the right model yet, but corner people long enough and they’ll figure something out. “Old Media” is nothing if not cornered. Don’t discount the need to make sense of all the noise and what that might be worth; we just have to figure out where value lies.</p>

<p>So maybe free’s just another word for nothing left to lose (now managing to get two song title cliches into a single post) or the price to entry for players who can’t demand a market price. Then price becomes, like Veblen goods, sort of (these are goods that, for psychological reasons, greater price infers greater status or perceived value), an actual mechanism of value. It’s early yet and bringing prices back depends on most all of the players to start charging, an interesting problem for game theorists.</p>

    <p>There’s no other word for it but Kitsch, and it’s all over the iPad, from Apple’s own apps to the horrible AP News app. Hopefully this sort of thing will shake out, except that it seems that Apple is responsible for it. Follow the link below for a really thoughtful post on designing for the iPad:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Everybody in the iA team strongly doubted the validity of that particular guideline. Yet since we had no way to reality check it, we went full steam ahead: <em>Everything 3D! Make a newspaper look like a newspaper! Make that wordprocessor look like a type writer! Use wooden backgrounds!</em> And why? Because Apple said so.</blockquote>
