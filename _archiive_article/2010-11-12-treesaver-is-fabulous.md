<a href="http://treesaver.net/">Treesaver</a> is a new way of presenting narrative content that combines a website with the structure of an ebook that scales to whatever device it's being viewed on. While this first example, "<a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/treesaver/tuna/">Looting the Seas</a>," won't be of interest to everyone, <a href="http://readnomad.com/">Nomad editions</a> will also be launching with this format.

There's been a fair amount written about Treesaver already, so I'll limit my comments to a couple of things. The execution is really well done. So many projects I've seen in the ebook space have an amateurish air to them, but this is really polished. But the remarkable thing is its scalability. It's not just that the site gets smaller or bigger, but it's the way that it actually scales.

Web developers have long grappled with the idea of "fluid" designs  - sites that change size with the size of the browser. I've never used the fluid design technique on my sites because they have a fatal flaw. Fluid designs tend to grow or shrink column sizes to fill the space of the viewport. To be readable, text needs to be scannable, that is, your eye needs to flow from one line to the next without having to stop and think about it. The width of the column needs to have a relationship with the size of the text or your eye loses the flow of the text. Treesaver uses a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive</a> design that keeps the columns of text at a proportionate size no matter the space. I find this terribly exciting.
