<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-pvtn9IXNo&amp;feature=player_embedded">PEN World Voices Festival</a>"Blogs, Twitter, the Kindle: The Future of Reading" was the panel I went to at PEN World Voices Festival (video) that - If you happened to have followed my <a href="http://twitter.com/budparr">twitter</a> stream during the event you know  - I was quite disappointed by the direction it took, primarily because I thought it was a lost opportunity for some really terrific, serious writers to discuss the fate of literary culture in the digital age, as the program promised. From the PEN World Voices Festival <a href="http://www.pen.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/4728/prmID/1986">introduction</a> to the panel:
<blockquote>Philip Roth recently said that reading novels would be a “cultic” activity in 25 years, adding that “the book can’t compete with the screen.” Do other writers share his pessimism? How does the situation differ across cultures and continents—and are there lessons in those differences?</blockquote>
Instead, the discussion dwelled on trivialities like the "Toy Story" (a movie, if for some strange reason you don't know it) app on the iPad, which in my view has little do with the type of literature everyone on the panel writes and entirely mocks the issue. I highly doubt Roth was being so obvious when he said that. Or... maybe I'm just grumpy, other commenters on the panel weren't so disappointed.

There were some highlights when panelists talked about their blogging and twitter activity, but even those comments were pretty much dead-on-arrival, and one of the panelists chose not to add anything at all, but instead let us know how sharp his sense of irony is. Definitely the low point of an otherwise terrific festival.

If you want to see some serious discussion of the matter, head upstate next month for the Rochester Institute of Technology's <a href="http://futureofreading.cias.rit.edu/2010/index.php">"Future of Reading"</a> conference, which I hope <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=2680">Chad Post</a> will be covering in detail.

p.s. My question comes in the 58:30 mark. I asked two questions. The first was whether or not anyone on the panel had read an entire book on an iPad/Kindle/Nook/Sony Reader in the past year. Only one of the panelists said yes, he had.
