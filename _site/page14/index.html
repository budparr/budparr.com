        Laird Hunt’s The Exquisite
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2006</span>

    <p>!{float:left;margin-right:18px}http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1566891876.01.<em>SCMZZZZZZZ</em>.jpg(altimage)! If you liked Charlie Kaufman’s “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” or Alejandro Amenábar’s “Open Your Eyes (remade as Vanilla Sky), then I’d bet you’ll like Laird Hunt’s latest novel <em>The Exquisite</em>. I know I’m getting off cheap by putting a novel in a category with a couple of films, but those two exceptional movies came to mind when reading the book. Like those films, <em>The Exquisite</em> is a quirky ‘don’t-know-exactly-where-reality-begins-and-ends’ type of story, which is quite appealing to a mindset that’s open to the “improbable,” as Hunt aptly characterizes his book.
I knew I would like <em>The Exquisite</em> when I saw the epigraph quoting Fernando Pessoa’s The Book of Disquiet: ”<em>I fainted during a bit of my life. I regain consciousness without any memory of what I was, and the memory of who I was suffers for having been interrupted. There is in me a confused notion of an unknown interval, a futile effort on the part of my memory to want to find that other memory. I don’t connect myself with myself. If I’ve lived, I forget having known it.</em>” Epigraphs often mean more to the author than to the reader, but once you’ve read <em>The Exquisite</em> you realize just how well this quote fits, so much so that you can imagine the narrator speaking those words himself. “Once upon a time I was someone then that stopped,” he begins.
Henry, our unlikable unreliable narrator lives in the East Village in New York City. He’s something of a ne’er-do-well who slips into a seedy existence after his girlfriend leaves him and he falls in with an odd gang of fake murderers. Now, when I say fake murderers I may mean that they did fake murders, or they were fake murderers, or their fake murders were fake, or something like that, but I’ll leave that for you to decide when you read the book. Much of the story centers around one of those fake murderers whose murder doesn’t seem to be so fake, who happens to be the namesake of a petty thief immortalized - maybe literally - in the Rembrandt painting <em>The Anatomy Lesson</em> as the subject of a public dissection.
Aris Kindt, this namesake of the man dissected for posterity, enters Henry’s life with a tinge of risk and eroticism that he finds at once perplexing and comfortable:
bq. “It was this deep enjoyment of orchestrated experiences in which pain and pleasure lay tightly coiled that had prompted Mr. Kindt, I presumed, to take out a membership at the Eleventh Street Russian baths, a venerable mobster-frequented establishment where what I took to be blast furnaces filled with boiling, beet-red lumps of flesh coexisted with sinister massage cabinets and a deep icy pool…It was Mr. Kindt’s rule, one that Tulip and I were both happy to comply with, that if we came with him we did all of it. So it was that, to my surprising delight, I had a huge guy sit on my back, soap me up, whack me with oak branches, and time and again pour near-frozen water on me…”
When we meet Mr. Kindt, he is sitting in the dark, naked, strapped to a heart monitor as Henry is burglarizing him. He doesn’t get any less strange as the story goes on, not in any of his incarnations, and neither do any of his equally odd colleagues, all of whom seem to have stepped out of a Quentin Tarantino movie (this is my last movie mention, I swear); like Cornelius, who wears a hunting cape, or the “contortionist twins,” or Tulip the beautiful tattoo artist, and finally a bartender enigmatically named Job  - I imagine after Job in the Bible or perhaps of the Robert Heinlein book, <em>Job: a Comedy of Justice</em>, or maybe just job, like an act of crime - who also seems to appear with different names.
In fact, many people show up with different names or as different people in <em>The Exquisite</em>. The main thread of the book consists of Henry’s hospital experience where he chronicles the time that makes up the rest of the book - the events, we find, that have led him there - and generally hallucinates (maybe hallucinates) a set of characters who parallel others in the other story. It’s not as confusing as I make it sound, not, that is, if you don’t try too hard to make sense of it.
I don’t believe Hunt ever used the word exquisite in the text, but the title is a well earned compliment as the book is indeed “ingeniously devised” as the name suggests and Hunts writing fits the bill as well. I was struck - this is a small but telling thing - by his use of the word “truffle” as a verb at the end of the book in the acknowledgment section (which section, by the way, holds a key to the story that is alluded to about half-way through, but cryptically). By all accounts truffle is a noun - suggesting to me Hunt’s joie des mots and playfulness with language. It’s clear that Hunt likes to explore the various meanings a word can take on, just like the names people take or the way they change themselves with or without their clothes or tattoos etched into their skin. This manifests itself in words like the aforementioned “Job” or “swell” or “fleck” that he uses repeatedly, or the way he channels meaning with things like fish (as a friend, a food, a subject of a dream and a symbol) and cigars - Kindt smokes Dutch Masters (think Rembrandt).
Any complaints I have are trifling compared to the overall experience here, but Hunt seems to have had a few set-pieces on New York City in his head that felt slightly out of place as I read, and there is a seemingly obligatory or compulsive placement of a 9/11 placemark that seemed to me to have little purpose. Ultimately though, <em>The Exquisite</em> is full of deliciously bad characters (Aunt Lulu, who might have been a cat murderer, is a particular favorite) rich allusions and an uncertain reality that, if you’re comfortable with that sort of thing, is a lot of fun.

        Update on New York City Independent Bookstores
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>
[UPDATE: Unfortunately, I'm told that Lenox Hill Books is closing its doors]
</p>
<p>
As I roam around New York City I mark areas by their restaurants and bookstores and thats how I think of them. It's amazing that while B&#038;N and Amazon seem to dominate the landscape we have so many great independent bookstores. I don't know if they're thriving, but while some have closed others have opened.
</p>
<p>
It's been a while since I looked at my list of New York City independent bookstores and that exercise is long overdue. Today I updated McNally Robinson, which I put back in the 4th spot, tied in my view with St. Marks. I'll be revisiting some of my commentary here and adding Brooklyn stores too, some of which I've grown fond of in my short time in the Borough of Kings.
</p>
<p>
See also the comments section of a post at <a href="http://metaxucafe.com/cafe/content/article/call_to_members_post_your_favorite_bookstore/">MetaxuCafe</a> for some other great bookstores.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, note that the Colson Whitehead, Edmund White, Joyce Johnson, Sharon Olds and others from the <a href="http://www.bookcritics.org/page2.html" target="_blank">National Book Critics Circle</a> will announce finalists for their 2006 NBCC awards at <a href="http://www.mcnallyrobinsonnyc.com/events.shtml" target="_blank">McNally Robinson</a> on Saturday, January 14th at 7pm.
</p>
<p>
This list is in order of personal preference. For more information on limitations to the selection, see below.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.joycesociety.org/fw_frame.html" target="_blank" title="Gotham Book Mart">Gotham Book Mart</a></strong>
<br />16 East 46th Street (btwn 5th/Madison)
<br />212 719-4448
</p>
<p>
Simply the best bookstore in the city. Personal service, a rich history and a deep collection of serious literature. Both new and used books, including classics, poetry (probably the best in the city), many author-specific collections. The ultimate in browsing, even if the location is too midtowney to suggest from the outside that it has character. Gotham used to be the only place you needed to go to find literary journals. Since their recent move one block away - but seemingly a million miles from their old location - their journal collection has thinned. Hopefully that will change as they get settled in. See my previous <a href="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/08/wise_men_have_f.html" target="_blank" title="article on Gotham Book Mart">article</a> on Gotham for more information.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://threelives.com/">Three Lives &#038; Company</a></strong>
<br />154 West 10th Street (at Waverly Place)
<br />212-741-2069
</p>
<p>
Named in part for a Gertrude Stein book, Three Lives is a bookstore's bookstore. It really is a perfectly beautiful store. The owner has excellent taste and you can always find something interesting and new from some small presses as well as the majors. There are no used books here, so don't go looking for any bargains. Most but not all of the books at Three Lives are trade paperbacks. The poetry section is smallish, but there is a travel section, a New York section, staff picks and a selection of books on writing. The store hosts readings by popular authors, information about which you can find on their web-site. (p.s. Don't go to Three Lives without stopping by Joe, The Art of Coffee, for a near perfect ristretto espresso. Joe is around the block at the corner of Waverly and Gay.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mercer Street Books</strong>
<br />206 Mercer St. (at Bleeker)
<br />212 505-8615
</p>
<p>
This is one of my favorite used bookstores. They have a solid selection of fiction in hard and paper-back, literary criticism, classics and poetry. It's proximity to New York University is probably responsible for its good selection of criticism and other serious stuff; be sure to check out the recent arrivals table. They also have a selection of old literary journals, which are fun (if such things fit your idea of fun) to pick through randomly.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.mcnallyrobinsonnyc.com/">McNally Robinson</a></strong>
<br />50 Prince St. (between Lafayette and Mulberry)
<br />(212)274-1160
</p>
<p>
McNally Robinson is related to but independent of the Canadian company of the same name. It's great to see new bookstores opening and McNally Robinson appeared just last December in neighborhood nowadays called Nolita. They have pretty a active event calendar and a &#8220;tea house.&#8221; They have a small selection of literary journals, and a decent emphasis on good literature for a general bookstore. In fact, they have a &#8220;local poets&#8221; section set aside (of course this is New York City, so that could, practically speaking, be quite large, but it isn't. They also arrange their fiction into regions, which is unique and welcome. The selection is not huge, but appears to be thoughtful.
</p>
<p>
Update: I had previously reported that McNally Robinson had shrunk their literary selection, but after speaking to the folks there, I am assured that the space has grown, so I've retracted my earlier comment.
</p>
<p>
From Mcnally Robinson's buyer: &#8220;...the shelf space devoted to Lit has only grown since we opened...Literature happens to be squeezed into a physically tighter area in the more valuable upstairs real estate, but there are more books on the shelf than before. Initially I didn't believe it either.  Then I got a tape measure out. Interesting how we humans perceive space.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.stmarksbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp">St. Marks Bookshop</a></strong>
<br />31 Third Ave. (at E. 9th)
<br />212 260-7853
</p>
<p>
Fairly mainstream bookstore, but St. Marks does have a good selection of literature/culture and art books that to some degree reflect the neighborhood. Probably the second best place, behind Gotham, for literary journals. The poetry and fiction sections are by no means comprehensive, but well chosen. There are no used books here. (p.s. If you go to St. Marks, you must stop by the Mud truck at the Astor Place subway for one of the best cups of coffee in the city.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.housingworks.org/usedbookcafe/index.html">Housing Works Used Book Cafe</a></strong>
<br />126 Crosby Street (at Houston)
<br />212 334-3324
</p>
<p>
The UBC is a great store for browsing and finding bargains. You can find a book and relax in the cafe. The environment is warm, the building is classic and there's a pretty wide selection of literature, always very cheap. Also, your money is well spent here, because 100% of the profits go to Housing Works, a non-profit organization that provides housing, healthcare, job training, advocacy and many other services for homeless New Yorkers living with HIV and Aids. That alone is worth doing some shopping there. They are having a sale this weekend (Jan 8/9) too, when everything is 30% off.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.strandbooks.com/home/">The Strand Annex</a></strong>
<br />95 Fulton Street (3 blocks east of Broadway)
<br />212 732-6070
</p>
<p>
The Annex is much better for browsing than its parent. A fairly deep used fiction selection (a lot of hardbacks) and much more space between the shelves to maneuver (the main Strand store can get very cramped and crowded).
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://labyrinthbooks.com/StoreFrame.htm">Labyrinth Books</a></strong>
<br />536 West 112th Street (btwn. Brdwy/Amsterdam Ave.)
<br />212 865-1588
</p>
<p>
Described as a store of scholarly, literary &#038; cultural books, Labyrinth serves the Columbia U. smarties. This bookstore has an amazing literature collection, including poetry, but major authors only. You will sometimes find what you are looking for discounted 25%, but don't count on it. The real bargains are at the <a href="http://www.labyrinthbooks.com//main.asp?">sale annex</a>, which is only on-line, but where the prices tend to hover around $5-6. Some of the books from the annex, however, do find their way to Labyrinth's staircase even though that inventory doesn't seem to change much.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.strandbooks.com/home/" target="_blank" title="The Strand">The Strand</a></strong>
<br />828 Broadway (at 12th St.)
<br />212 473-1452
</p>
<p>
18 Miles of Books. Overated, but probably the best place to sell your used books. Great for browsing and with enough effort you may find some bargains, but there are tons of (only) slightly discounted books. The Strand does have one specialty that is unparalleled as far as I know and that is their reviewer's copy section, tucked away in the basement. These are all new and recently published books at 1/2 off of their original price. Don't expect to find anything hot there though.
</p>
<p>
The Strand also has a kiosk at 5th Ave and 60th for a quick fix on your way to Cipriani's for a $19 glass of scotch.
</p>
<p>
<strong>12th St. Books</strong>
<br />11 East 12th St.
<br />212 645-4340
</p>
<p>
A smallish all used bookstore with a mixture of hard and paper-backs and a variety of subjects. Never a first stop, but worth a drop by if you're at the Strand (which is close by).
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.murderink.com/Search.bok?category=Signed+Firsts" target="_blank" title="Murder Ink">Ivy Books/Murder Ink</a></strong>
<br />2488 Broadway (btwn W. 92nd/W. 93rd)
<br />212 362-8905
</p>
<p>
Murder Ink claims to carry every mystery book in print and I think that speaks for itself. Next door, Ivy carries a mixture of new and used literature. It's a small, quaint, homey shop (I think it was in the Visa ad with Kevin Bacon) that is always worth a stop.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Biography Bookshop</strong>
<br />400 Bleecker St. (at 11th St)
<br />212 807-8655
</p>
<p>
The best thing about BB is its location on a picturesque street in the village and the sale table outside. It seems that I always find a bargain there.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.192books.com/" target="_blank" title="192 Books">192 Books</a></strong>
<br />192 Tenth Avenue (at 21st  St)
<br />212 255.4022
</p>
<p>
Okay, so the name is not too creative, but it's a pleasant stop with a small but well chosen selection of literature and non-fiction and an art space. There are bargains to be had on a small cart toward the front, but most of the inventory consists of new paperbacks. The bookstore serves at the pleasure of its owners who also own an art gallery nearby, choose the books and set up the impressive readings the store hosts.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://turtlepoint.com/lenox/" target="_blank" title="Lenox Hill Bookstore">Lenox Hill Bookstore</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
[closing January, 2006]
</p>
<p>
1018 Lexington Avenue (btwn. 72nd/73rd)
<br />212 472-7170
</p>
<p>
Yeah, so it's on the Upper East Side. It's still a nice bookstore. Very Pleasant with a selection of the latest editions in literature and general non-fiction. Pretty mainstream stuff for the most part, but they have started their own &#8220;Chapbook Series&#8221; publishing and a &#8220;First Editions Club&#8221; if that's your sort of thing. I consider myself a reader, not a collector, but I do like to see bookshop owners venturing out and doing interesting things.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.shakeandco.com/index.php" target="_blank" title="Shakespeare &amp; Co.">Shakespeare &#038; Co.</a></strong><strong>
<br /></strong>939 Lexington Ave. (at 69th)
<br />212 570-0201
</p>
<p>
137 E. 23rd St. (at Lexington)
<br />212 505-2021
</p>
<p>
716 Broadway (at Washington Pl.)
<br />212 529-1330
</p>
<p>
There are more Shake &#038; Co. locations than I've listed. The one on broadway tends to have somewhat subversive collection, but otherwise all of the stores are fairly mainstream. Some sell textbooks, most sell magazines, but light on the journals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Crawford Doyle</strong>
<br />21 E 90th St
<br />212 289 2345
</p>
<p>
Ah, another Upper East Sider. Whenever I brush off my passport to go to that side of town I try to stop by Crawford Doyle. It's small and sells mostly new paperbacks and general non-fiction, but they do have an interesting collection of rare books to look at. It's always fun for an occasional browse.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://coliseumbooks.com/" target="_blank" title="Coliseum Books">Coliseum Books</a></strong>
<br />11 West 42nd St. (Btwn 5th/6th Ave across from Bryant Park)
<br />212 803-5890
</p>
<p>
Coliseum is overrated. They seem to be trying to be all things to all people. Now they have a cafe and a not terribly helpful staff. The selection is spotty (my impression is that it was better before they moved to their new location) and doesn't seem to be too serious anywhere. i.e. I never find myself saying...&#8220;I'm looking for X book, maybe I should stop at Coliseum first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.posmanbooks.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp" target="_blank" title="Posman Books">Posman Books</a></strong>
<br />9 Grand Central Terminal (Vanderbilt &#038; 42nd Street)
<br />212-983-1111
</p>
<p>
Posman used to be a good bookstore. They used to be right next to NYU and carried textbooks and an interesting selection of some serious stuff that you might not find elsewhere. Now they are very general, they sell a lot of paperbacks and serve GCT commuters, not book lovers.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.churchill-books.com/">Chartwells Books</a></strong>
<br />55 East 52nd St. (In the arcade of the Park Avenue Plaza building between Park &#038; Madison Avenues)
<br />212 308-0643
</p>
<p>
This store is dedicated to books by and about Winston Churchill. Much of their inventory is on-line, but the smallish store is pleasant and quiet with a small collection of literature and things like military books or foreign affairs, mostly in hardbound.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Westsider Used &#038; Rare</strong>
<br />2246 Broadway (at 80th)
<br />212 362-0706
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few opportunities to buy used books around the Upper West Side. There are a lot of books being sold on tables on the street and there are little bookstores tucked away where you wouldn't know they are there, such as Gryphon Bookshop. One of them (the name escapes me) finally gave up and closed its dusty doors, but there are still others fighting the good fight. Westsider is one of them. Books stacked to its very tall ceiling (it has a loft, so the main floor is two stories), it's a fun place to pop into once in a while. As with most used bookstores, you never know what you will find. Unfortunately, the fiction section seems to be all paperbacks, which are not appealing to me because they've already used a good part of their limited life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Biases:</strong>
</p>
<p>
This list is not meant to be a comprehensive list of stores. Here are my biases:
</p>
<p>
First, these are only Manhattan shops, where, for the moment, I hang my hat and therefore buy my books. There are great bookstores that I know about in Brooklyn and upstate New York and the Berkshires, but then things start to get out of hand.
</p>
<p>
This list is mostly concerned with literature and not special interests. In NYC there are bookstores that sell nothing but cookbooks, there are gay bookstores like the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore, there are travel bookstores, like the Complete Traveller (with an amazing used and rare travel book collection), stores that specialize in rare collectible books like Bauman's or Argosy, children's bookstores like Books of Wonder, art bookstores, and so on. Again, things would get out of hand if I were to try and write about all of them, and literature is my only interest in terms of the pastime of browsing for and buying books. I've also only listed independent stores here because no one needs me to tell them about Barnes &#038; Noble (although they do have a good annex on 18th st, their original store I think, where they have text books and such).
</p>
<p>
My last bias is that I really really like to find cheap used hardcover books; they last longer and tend not to have reader annotations (which I avidly add myself). I buy fiction, criticism and poetry. These stores are the places I go to find those things. If you know of a place worth checking out, I'd love to hear about it.

If he has the means he buys a sports car or a boat, or if he's Harry Mathews he becomes a spy for CIA.
</p>
<p>
Well, not really a spy; he pretended. He pretended to be a spy because circumstances opened themselves to it and he was an adventurous, creative guy who also happened to be a little bored.
</p>
<p>
The setting for My Life in CIA (those in the know don't use &#8220;the&#8221; in front of CIA, we learn) is Paris, France over the course of 1973. Harry Mathews is a divorced, well-to-do 43 year old man of the 70s - &#8220;snug black velvet bellbottoms&#8221; and all  - whose cocktail party friends suspect as being a spy. Every denial becomes a confirmation in their eyes so he decides to indulge and ride the intrigue for whatever mischievous fun he can find. Here's an example:
</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;The following Monday I started passing the Saint Germain <em>without</em> going in. I carried a briefcase and walked briskly west down Boulevard Saint-Germain. On the corner of Rue Saint-Simon I stopped in the recessed doorway of a bookstore and looked back. No sign of my mark, not the first morning or the next; the third he was there. I led him by a devious route - Rues de Bellechasse, Varenne, Bourgogne, Las-Cases - to the church of Sainte Clothilde. I walked slowly and expectantly round the little park in front of the church. Then I hurried home a quite different way. I made sure I never lost my tail.
<br />
<br />That afternoon I took the metro to Saint Augustin on the right bank. I got straight into a taxi that deposited me, back on the other side of town, near an Avis garage in the fifteenth arrondissement. I rented their cheapest model, a Peugeot 204. For half an hour I had fun practicing &#8221;evasive driving techniques&#8220; before heading for Sainte Clothilde. I pulled into the first space that opened up on the park side of Rue Marignan. Before leaving I cracked the rear window next to the sidewalk, left the same door unlocked, and pasted a two-inch strip of Scotch tape over its lower edge.&#8221;
</blockquote>
<p>
Most I think, might be unnerved and stop the game after being followed by a stranger, but of course most people probably wouldn't pretend to be a spy. If a little Sunday cloak and dagger were not enough, Mathews goes so far as to create a company to act as cover and go out in the world laying a trail of open questions for the &#8220;real&#8221; spies to find. And find him they do.
</p>
<p>
As the tall tale grows, Matthews meets a cast of mysterious strangers - the tantric lover, Marie-Claude Quintelpreux - &#8220;...release the demons in you that molest pure yearning!&#8221; Or, Florence, who is forty inches tall and &#8220;perfect in every limb,&#8221; who saves Mathew's life in the obligatory foot-sex-with-a-midget-in-a-church-after-being-hosted-to-drinks-and-dancing-with-Zendor-an evildoer-whose-house-you-find-yourself-in-after-being-whisked-away-naked-in-an-exotic-rug scene.
</p>
<p>
There are also some true spies, opportunists, ruffians, beautiful women, communists and assassins who either don't know what to make of our hero, want something they think he's got, or want him out of the way; permanently. Through his odd encounters, we glimpse along with Mathews a world beyond the cocktail party chatter and intellectual ideas where he came from into a world of concrete action and cause-and-effect - as in, these people mean business. Mathews finds himself not so much deeply involved in the game of spying as in the brutality of staying alive.
</p>
<p>
As enjoyable as the Mathews' story is, I think that it also illuminates elements of the absurd character that geopolitics can take on, and how we all, playing our small roles, are taken in by it, sometimes forgetting that the consequences are often harsh. Mathews also captures a nervousness among some of his elite friends and others he encounters that might be as good as any snapshot of 1973. In one scene, Mathews speaks to a group of communists about his made-up geopolitical views but all they care to hear about is Watergate, a subject about which they seem hopelessly naive. It is not until he meets people in the country - far removed from the social and political scene - that the frenetic life he (momentarily) left behind can be seen for what it is.
</p>
<p>
I read My Life in CIA one afternoon over the summer. Fitting for the season, I'd say, because it's fast paced, fun and something of a farce. If you're one of those habitual daydreamers like me, you'll enjoy Mathews' winking Graham Greenesque account of playing spy and even if you're not, you'll enjoy his crafty story telling and the occasional reference to velvet clothes and a few other '70s artifacts.

I've updated my <a href="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2005/04/new_york_city_i.html">New York City Independent Bookstore Guide</a> to reflect (possibly not good) changes at McNally Robinson Bookstore. I knocked them down a couple of notches because it looks like they've thinned out their literature (and maybe even poetry) section in favor of more non-fiction.

        Jane {a murder}, by Maggie Nelson
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2005</span>

    <p>
I almost didn't pick up Maggie Nelson's book <em>Jane {a murder}</em>. The title and the photo on the cover said to me &#8220;this is not a book for you.&#8221; Looking at the back cover, phrases like &#8220;dark, female masterpiece,&#8221; &#8220;true story of a murder&#8221; and &#8220;blurred-genre memoir&#8221; all confirmed that this was a book to put on the bottom of the burgeoning stack. Somewhere inside of me though, I like to think there exists a sixth sense, a nagging intuition about good books that made me pick up <em>Jane</em> just to read a page or two. I didn't put it down again.
</p>
<p>
<em>Jane {a murder}</em> is a classified as a book of poetry and a book of true crime. It is all things described, but none of those capture its singular purpose and its classification doesn't matter when you read it. It's a story well told of a woman brutally killed and another woman yearning to know more about the ever present shade of her murdered aunt. Jane was murdered in 1969 while a student at the University of Michigan. Four years later, Jane's sister had a daughter who knew about her aunt, but never quite enough and certainly never about the night she was shot, which was just one in a series of media-sensationalized killings dubbed the &#8220;Michigan Murders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As an antidote to that sensationalism, Nelson explores Jane's life and death with a poet's sensibility through anecdotes, clippings and diary entries. Her skill as a poet is matched by the way she weaves these various elements together as a deft storyteller. In fact, the diary entries, which were written years before her murder are not all in chronological order, but seamlessly placed in the order, perhaps, of Maggie Nelson's emotional discovery.
</p>
<p>
These two passages sit on facing pages. The first is Jane's diary entry from 1966, around the age of twenty, three years before her death:
</p>
<blockquote>
Careless dribble - again
<br />
<br />Strange, lying in bed
<br />unable to sleep
<br />
<br />That's all familiar
<br />but the thoughts inside of me
<br />are not
<br />
<br />Questions, over and over
<br />home too long, back too soon
<br />
<br />alone, really alone
<br />
<br />What are you like when you're alone
<br />
<br />ugly, heavy, disreputable
<br />unsure, awake, useless
<br />
<br />This room is hideous
</blockquote>
<p>
The next page, titled &#8220;Hideous&#8221;, comes after Ms. Nelson has maybe come to know too much about Jane's murder:
</p>
<blockquote>
Unable to sleep, surrounded by
<br />her words. Afraid, truly afraid
<br />
<br />to tell you about my brain
<br />chattering with cruelties-
<br />
<br />When did she know
<br />she was in danger;
<br />
<br />the terrible little gun
<br />flat against her head;
<br />
<br /><em>which shot first,
<br />the front or the back?
<br /></em>
<br />The fear,
<br />her fear
<br />
<br />but I cannot imagine that.
<br />
<br /><em>Why keep trying?</em>
<br />I can hear you say. Well
<br />
<br />I can't help it. I just do. Then
<br />to stop the thoughts, I imagine
<br />
<br />two quick, dull shots
<br />that come as a sort of relief. Don't you know,
<br />
<br />I recognize this
<br />as hell.
<br />
<br />I try to use the tricks I've learned to get through this-
<br />
<br /><em>Meditate on a wrathful deity.
<br />Watch it melt into light.
<br /></em>
<br />And so I do, and find
<br />that not even Kali
<br />
<br />with her mouth full of blood
<br />non Thor with his hammer
<br />
<br />can take me away from here, where
<br />your breath spouts out of you
<br />
<br />and I listen.
</blockquote>
<p>
Ms. Nelson took some license with Jane's diary entries, at the least creating line-breaks, but she uses them to such great affect that they become Jane's cries. What under normal circumstances are fairly typical reflections on youthful angst and self-doubt - &#8220;right now I hate my sister so...I am jealous of Barb's fun, dates, looks, assurance...&#8221; - become here the private truths of a woman denied her life before she had a chance to work them out - &#8220;This kid doesn't know anything. / She'd like to sleep the childish slumber of a baby and yet live in a world of complexities.&#8221; -  through them we come closer to understanding her tragedy, not so much through pathos but empathy.
</p>
<p>
What makes the difference between pathos and empathy is restraint. That is a strength in this book. Halfway through we are led to the murder scene, the press and investigation, meditations on blood -  &#8220;Can anyone like blood the way one likes the mountain or the sea&#8221; - the freaks that call Jane's grieving parents - &#8220;<em>Where's Jane, boo-hoo-hoo</em>&#8221; - and other detritus left in the wake of a brutal murder, like the psychic brought in to solve the case of the serial killer - &#8220;<em>Her face was beat, beat, beat. It was wrinkled like a monkey's</em>.&#8221; But before she takes us too far down the path of &#8220;true-crime,&#8221; just when we start to feel like voyeurs getting too close, Nelson puts down the looking-glass and stops to breath - &#8220;Somehow I need to make it clear: none of these details belongs to me.&#8221; By then though, like stumbling across a dead body, we can't forget what we've seen - &#8220;the imaginary is what tends / to become real, and when it does / there's no paint black enough / to cover it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
In the beginning of the book, Nelson imagines the final moments of Jane's life:
</p>
<blockquote>
She had been shot once in the front and once in the back of the head. She wandered, trying to find someone to remove the slugs from her skull. She was not dead yet, but she feared she was dying.The holes in her head were perfectly round and bloodless, with burnt-flared edges, two eclipses. The passage of air through the holes felt peculiar, just dimly painful, like chewing hot or cold food on a cavity, the sensation of space where it had once been dense and full.
<br />
<br />Sunlight shot around the circumference of each black rind, so that a long shaft of pale light cast out from the center of her forehead, and another shaft streamed behind her.
<br />
<br /><em>Is this the light of the mind? Is this the light of </em><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>my</em></span><em> mind?</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
This would be an easy passage to overdo, but I think it's great. It tells us right in the beginning that the author has put herself as nearly as she can imagine into the shoes of Jane. And although Jane's parents don't figure prominently in the book, this piece, where she says &#8220;the sensation of space where it had once been dense and full&#8221; signifies their loss, the void where there was once a life.
</p>
<p>
<em>Jane</em> works so well because the poetry itself is nearly invisible. So much contemporary poetry tends to be too self-conscious to let its meaning work on you, but Maggie Nelson's poems manage to both fluidly pull us through the story and stand alone  - they are purposeful and poignant with no pretense. Indeed, I would classify <em>Jane {a murder}</em> as a page-turner.
