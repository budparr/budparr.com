        Treesaver is Fabulous
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Nov 2010</span>

    <p><a href="http://treesaver.net/">Treesaver</a> is a new way of presenting narrative content that combines a website with the structure of an ebook that scales to whatever device it’s being viewed on. While this first example, “<a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/treesaver/tuna/">Looting the Seas</a>,” won’t be of interest to everyone, <a href="http://readnomad.com/">Nomad editions</a> will also be launching with this format.</p>

<p>There’s been a fair amount written about Treesaver already, so I’ll limit my comments to a couple of things. The execution is really well done. So many projects I’ve seen in the ebook space have an amateurish air to them, but this is really polished. But the remarkable thing is its scalability. It’s not just that the site gets smaller or bigger, but it’s the way that it actually scales.</p>

<p>Web developers have long grappled with the idea of “fluid” designs  - sites that change size with the size of the browser. I’ve never used the fluid design technique on my sites because they have a fatal flaw. Fluid designs tend to grow or shrink column sizes to fill the space of the viewport. To be readable, text needs to be scannable, that is, your eye needs to flow from one line to the next without having to stop and think about it. The width of the column needs to have a relationship with the size of the text or your eye loses the flow of the text. Treesaver uses a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive</a> design that keeps the columns of text at a proportionate size no matter the space. I find this terribly exciting.</p>

        Making Ebooks is as Easy as Blogging: My Instapaper(book) on Paul Muldoon
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Nov 2010</span>

    <p><a href="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/Internet_dog_pub-268x3001.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-949" src="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/Internet_dog_pub-268x3001.jpg" alt="On the internet nobody knows you're not a publisher" width="268" height="300" /></a>In the not-distant future, the idea of a book or magazine will be much more fluid than it is today, partly because they are easier to produce than in the past, and partly because we will come to expect them to be different.</p>

<p><strong>Repackaging Content</strong></p>

<p>One wonders how many of the hundreds of thousands of books published every year are collections of work already published, such as stories or essays. What is the value in repackaging previously published material? Sometimes, like the case with short stories, they are inaccessible in their original form because they were published in many different journals of varying levels of availability. Also, putting a collection together gives the individual pieces some needed context or force of argument, as is the case with Alex Ross’s collection of essays, <em>Listen to This</em>, bringing together Ross’s <em>New Yorker</em> articles that, so far as I can tell, aim specifically to bridge a gap between popular and classical music (there is one previously unpublished essay in the book). For a long time now professors have pulled together “books” of a variety of material for their students, and today you can put your own “book” together of Wikipedia articles with the click of a button (in PDF, OpenDocument Text, or Print-on-demand).</p>

<p><strong>Reading Content Outside of its Original Home</strong></p>

<p>We’ve become promiscuous with our nonfiction reading. Atomization began with RSS readers, which display content by date or topic, rather than just the source. Then, the swift change in the media environment drew lines (then blurred them) between writers and their publications. Now we read based on the recommendation of twitterers and “friends” rather than sitting down to our morning paper. Our sources might be chosen for a variety of reasons, not just the veneration of the package they came in. Apps like <a href="http://www.flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>, will further challenge our old reading habits. Interestingly, Instapaper - the online application that allows you to save articles to read later on your own device instead of its published source - gives publishers guidelines if they want their content to look its best through their service.</p>

<p><strong>Contexts Can Change</strong></p>

<p>The point is that content takes on meaning  depending on how it is packaged and consumed, and no one publication will have a monopoly on either. In the same way that I know people because of common interest rather than physical proximity (primarily because of my online activities), I read not - necessarily - based on publication, but on interest. I may sit one night and read articles and blog posts on publishing, then read about technology, or literature from other sets of sources.</p>

<p><strong>Crowd-Curation</strong></p>

<p>With the growing popularity of microblogs like <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and <a href="http://posterous.com">Posterous</a>, we all become curators as well as consumers. While a microblog may be an on-the-fly mechanism, we’re also seeing an interest in long-form writing (crowd-curated by sites like <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/browse">Instapaper</a> and <a href="http://longreads.com/">Longreads</a>). There’s no reason why that won’t turn into something more thoughtful where a body of essays or stories (perhaps collected from a site like <a href="http://www.fictionaut.com/">Fictionaut</a>) are curated and shared by anyone with the knowledge or time to assemble them. There will be issues, to be sure. Rights and the potential to manipulate content are just a couple to reckon with.</p>

<p>I’ve been fooling around with this idea in my head a bit. Books (or, broadly, publications) in any form are a vessel to focus our attention and to have some semblance of permanence, even if, as in the above examples, that is merely a matter of convenience or editorial choice. That much won’t change. What will change is the necessity for content to be emitted straight from a publisher’s hand to its final destination.</p>

<p><strong>One Example</strong></p>

<p>To the end of thinking about this in practical, if somewhat crude, terms, I created an ebook of related articles. I use <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> to collect articles and it’s become my preferred environment for reading on the iPad, even though what I really enjoy is the book-like environment of reading in an ereader, like iBooks. Instapaper has a feature on its website that allows you to create an EPUB (among other formats) of your content. By putting articles into a folder you can create a specific theme or whatever grouping you like of articles. Instapaper isn’t meant to create books, necessarily, so this is a bit rough, and just for fun anyway; it’s a bit wanting for formatting. Naturally, I didn’t secure any reprint rights for the content, though everything is sourced and linked to from the book. It’s not for sale and for private use only and will be linked to from here unless someone gets angry and wants me to take it down.</p>

<p><strong>A Good Subject</strong></p>

<p>I chose Paul Muldoon because while reading his latest collection Maggot, I also wanted to read The Paris Review interview of him, thinking that I’d like to read it on my iPad so I can get to it on the train. So, despite having the original print version, I went to The Paris Review website, saved it to Instapaper, then thought I’d put together some other pieces to draw a more complete picture.</p>

<p>The articles in this collection begin with Muldoon’s Wikipedia entry, several biographical articles, reviews and interviews, culminating in The Paris Review interview from 2004. There’s no poetry in the book because I fear formatting could easily be screwed up (see my previous <a href="http://ageofsand.com/2010/10/can-we-trust-poetry-ebooks-the-case-of-allen-ginsbergs-collected-poems/">post</a> on poetry formatting in EPUB).</p>

<p>So here it is, [<a href="http://ageofsand.com/documents/Instapaper(book) - Introduction to Paul Muldoon.epub.zip">An Introduction to Paul Muldoon</a>].</p>

    <p>I just saw this video posted by <a href="http://www.citylights.com/">City Lights</a> on Facebook of a 1965 reading at Royal Albert Hall with 19 poets including Allen Ginsberg, who I think organized the event, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Andrei Voznesenski, Harry Fainlight, Ernst Jandl, William Burroughs, and Christopher Logue. It’s such a fantastic video if for nothing else the energy in the room. I’ve been to poetry readings in large halls with at least a couple thousand people, but this is more like a rock concert of poetry - there were reportedly 7,000 people there with the audience an active participant. Aside from some of the antics, my favorite reading is from Christopher Logue. Here’s an excerpt on Youtube and somebody posted a longer one on MySpace (but I can’t seem to embed that, but you should definitely click through and watch it all).</p>

<p>Hard to believe it’s October, and funny to think that it was 16 years ago on Columbus Day that I moved to NYC.</p>

<p>I’ve lived on the Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Gramercy, Ft. Green and Carroll Gardens Brooklyn, and have spent an enormous amount of time in the West Village, where I also went to school at NYU, both undergraduate and graduate.</p>

<p>I’ve walked so many stretches of this city to see it as closely as possible. I buy my pickles on the Lower East Side. I shopped avidly at the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_Book_Mart">Gotham Book Mart</a> before that was more than a memory. I’ve been to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuyorican_Poets_Caf%C3%A9">Nuyorican Poets Café</a>, read on stage at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery_Poetry_Club">Bowery Poetry Club</a>, read a piece of my own at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB_(bar)">KGB Bar</a>, been to readings, lectures of all stripes, and held my own little debates in bars all over the city.</p>

<p>I met my wife at The Gingerman on 36th St. Took her to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumley's">Chumleys</a> (the former speakeasy with the hidden entrance and signed photos of the literary who’s who of time past, that is sadly no longer) on our first date and to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquin_Round_Table">storied</a> Algonquin on our second.  We got engaged in Central Park (see photo), had our wedding rehearsal dinner at the restaurant in Bryant Park, and were married at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Arts_Club">National Arts Club</a> in Gramercy Park. We had three kids at NY Presbyterian Hospital.</p>

<p>I’ve worked in the World Financial Center for Merill Lynch, spent much time at the World Trade Center, commuted to New Jersey, and after a major career change from Wall Street to technology, became part of the laptop in coffee shop revolution. I’ve had drinks or posh meals at the St. Regis and Cipriani’s; the top of the Chrysler building; stayed at The Plaza Hotel, when it was The Plaza Hotel. I’ve met or seen movie stars, royalty, diplomats and politicians. I’ve talked politics or books with some of the most incredibly bright minds one can imagine.</p>

<p>I’ve made money, gone broke, been unhappy then ecstatic. I’ve seen a lot, but nothing close to it all. Pretty much everything I am today is a result of being in NYC, yet to those who were born here, I’m not really a New Yorker. At least my three sons will be.</p>

        Can We Trust (Poetry) Ebooks? - The Case of Allen Ginsberg's Collected Poems
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Oct 2010</span>

    <p>As much as I love e-books, I wish publishers put more thought and effort into the design issues specific to them. From what I understand, most e-books published today come out of the same process as the print edition (something like, perhaps, Adobe InDesign) then <strong>exported</strong> into EPUB or MOBI (happy to hear from anyone who can clarify this).</p>

<p>As a web designer/developer (there are many similarities between front-end web code and e-books), I’ve never trusted the export function of any application. They tend to spit out extraneous code and open up vast possibilities for errors.</p>

<p>Notably, when the <em>Virginia Quarterly Review</em> published an EPUB version of their book-like journal earlier this year, they took pains on the journal’s EPUB design, going so far as to “optimize” it for Apple’s iBook application. The results showed.</p>

<p>It’s time publishers took a hard look at their workflow. Below are some examples. The first is a scan of a poem in Allen Ginsberg’s<em> Collected Poems 1947 - 1997</em>. The e-book version was released today. I downloaded samples from three vendors/apps for the iPad: Apple’s iBook, Barnes &amp; Noble’s Nook, and Amazon’s Kindle. I looked on Kobo but the book didn’t appear in their store.</p>

<p>This is the print edition, scanned. Note the structure of the lines.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1020" src="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="770" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Below is the Amazon Kindle edition. Text-size, color and pagination on all of these examples are variable, so should not be a final criteria. Note that the first line of every stanza is indented (this is on every poem, none of which are indented in the print edition). Also note that the line beginnings are completely different than the print edition.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_amazon_kindle.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1011" src="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_amazon_kindle.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a></p>

<p>Here is the Nook edition with the same problem with line beginnings:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_bn_nook.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1017" src="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_bn_nook.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a></p>

<p>And again with Apple’s iBook version:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_apple_ibook.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1014" src="/assets/img/uploads/2012/05/ginsberg_vision_apple_ibook.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a></p>

<p>Though the poem is readable, nothing can be taken for granted in a poet’s intent. Poetry e-books also suffer from the problem of variability of font sizes. I did a similar exercise with Jorie Graham’s <em>Sea Change</em>, which has long lines. Generally speaking, I’ve found line breaks to be okay, but making the font larger creates artificial line breaks and the degree of indentation is all over the board.</p>

<p>In an inteview with <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/07/23/am-kindle-isnt-kind-to-poetry/">American Public Media</a>, former U.S. poet Laureate Billy Collins maintains that electronic reading devices (by which I think he means EPUB readers, generally) aren’t well suited to poetry*:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Radke:</strong> How did you find the meaning of your poetry changed on the screen?

<strong>Collins:</strong> Well it wasn't so much the meaning, it was just that poetry comes in lines, like gaslone comes in gallons. If you wanted the name of the creature that is the poet, they are like homolinearium -- they're like line-making creatures.

<strong>Radke:</strong> Haha, yes.

<strong>Collins:</strong>And that's what we do, we make lines. Charles Olson, the poet, said no line must sleep, every line in a poem should be wakeful to the lines around it. And when you put a poem on a Kindle, the lines are broken in order to fit on the screen. And so instead of being the poet's decision, it becomes the device's decision.</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure if there’s a solution to font-size problem, and I hope that we don’t come to accept lower standards for the sake of e-books. Will we be stuck with PDFs for poetry, or apps only?</p>

<p>*thanks to Alizah at the <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/">Poetry Foundation</a> for the heads up on the Collins interview.</p>
