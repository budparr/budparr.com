<a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0009.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-364" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0009-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Love the new <em>New Yorker</em> iPad app. If I could have it as a subscription like I have for the print version (which I think I pay $25/yr for), I would certainly buy it, knowing that I'd never have to rip out another article to stick in my pocket as I run out of the house, and confident that I'd never wonder where 'that' article was I started a week ago and couldn't find. Digital trumps print hands down for periodicals.

<em>The New Yorker</em> app, like most all the magazine apps available now, is visually appealing. The ads are attractive yet not terribly distracting. The navigation is infinitely better than print, as well as the integrated video or audio content.

Yet, stepping back, magazine publishers are falling well short of the promise of the magical device they're publishing on.

Something's missing. Dynamism, to start. A replica of a printed magazine doesn't feel very dynamic because it's not. In fact, it appears to be only a step above Zinio magazines (whom, I assure you, if they don't innovate, will be in the graveyard soon because they really are nothing more than a replica of a print magazine and no better than a pdf file).

That ain't going to cut it.

I don't want to be a complainer. Really. If there were a good subscription model for <em>The New Yorker</em> iPad app, I would subscribe and bide time until it got better. I'd much rather read digital than print (on a dedicated device, that is, not a laptop) and I think everyone will in fairly short order as tablets and e-readers continue their march into the mainstream.

Yet, the fanfare of the common magazine app signals a march into digital with little more than lip service to the great potential for magazines. Here are a few observations:

1) Navigation is all over the place right now.  Some apps swipe right to left to go to a new page in an article - like a print magazine - and some scroll down - like a Website. Navigation from article to article is either a swipe or a tap  or a scroll to find other articles. The full page navigation is marginally helpful.

Here's where apps can learn from print. All print magazines I know of are consistent in the way one turns a page: a 'swipe'. It's nice not to confound expectations.

2) What e-pub (<a href="http://ageofsand.com/2010/06/vqr-is-the-smartest-magazine-on-the-planet-and-has-embraced-the-future-of-magazines/">my favorite format for magazines</a>) does so nicely is to let readers determine their own optimal text size. Images of magazines in an app are static and you can't even zoom in on them like you can with a web page on an iPad. Some are not bad. The New Yorker is readable despite choosing an unfriendly typeface in hopes - I suppose - of making long-time subscribers feel comfortable. But, the <em>MacLife</em> app (which also forgets your place when you leave the app, <em>grrr</em>) has small type.

The <em>National Geographic</em> app (powered by Zinio) is a hybrid in this regard. While flipping through the replica of the magazine, you are instructed to tap on a button to read the text. Doing so, you are given a text only version of the article (tada! flexible font-sizes). I've been reading <em>National Geographic</em> off and on since I was a kid. I would never. I mean NEVER have read text-only versions of their articles. Photographs are the heart of the magazine, and to separate the two because you know your replica of a magazine is unreadable otherwise is an inexcusable failure.

<em>Gourmet Magazine's</em> app, <em>Gourmet Live</em>, which I think is a hybrid, web-based app, does allow for font-size changes, though it's overall article design is linear, blog post-like and generally poor.

3) Magazines in the digital age should publish on a continuum. Like the feeds of blogs (and magazines) I read in my feed-reader, I want new articles to magically appear in my reading device (in real-time). In fact, I don't think magazines should publish issues at all. While some magazines, like <em>Current History</em>, publish thematically, many are merely time-based, like <em>The New Yorker</em>, and must realize that an "issue" is a term that should be filed away with "print."

"]<a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0005.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-370" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/09/IMG_0005-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>[/caption]

Streams of articles can be published when they are ready. The New Yorker already has follow up blog posts to articles on their website. In the app, those posts should be part of the article, as well as pertinent metadata.

I want to see magazines pull in related concepts or articles. The <em>Gourmet Live</em> app does this, though I don't care for the "game" aspect, or the fact that I can't do anything with it until I've registered (the social-media centric kids who must have designed the app assume that everyone using it <em>must</em> surely have a Facebook or Twitter account to log in with, creating yet one more barrier to using their product). However, I really admire the concept of actively involving users, though I think - as unsexy as it sounds - a table of related articles or a way to save articles in an iTunes-like format might be more helpful. I do think the <em>Gourmet Live</em> app is the smartest I've seen and one to watch for how it improves over time.

So yeah, this is a bit of a rant - constructive, hopefully - but I think it's worth questioning if "apps" are even the right medium for magazines. Apps can be ported from device to device, but without a standard format your magazine is that much more likely to disappear as devices come and go. Epub is a standard, it's flexible and accessible on a wide variety of devices. I think more energy should be put into making good magazines in a format that allows for dynamism and fluidity, and can fit into a library or some file system, and skip the sexy features. Publishers should think in terms of all the ways each and every piece of content can be distributed instead shoehorning old concepts into hot new devices. Don't let the tail (devices) wag the dog, as they say.
