<p>
I've updated my <a href="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2005/04/new_york_city_i.html">New York City Independent Bookstore Guide</a> to reflect (possibly not good) changes at McNally Robinson Bookstore. I knocked them down a couple of notches because it looks like they've thinned out their literature (and maybe even poetry) section in favor of more non-fiction.
