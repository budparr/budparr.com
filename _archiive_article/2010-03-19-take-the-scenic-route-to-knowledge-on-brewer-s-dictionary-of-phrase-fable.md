Packing my books away for our move, I keep running into great things I've not looked at in a while. One of them is <em>Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable</em>. I love dictionaries and reference books in the first place--have quite a few--but this one is truly unique. My edition is from 1970, the "Centenary Edition" as it was first published in 1870. To its credit, it's never been out of print, but truth is, even though there's a newer edition out this year even, it doesn't matter to me because the old dictionaries show words to be something of an artifact and etymologies don't really capture how meaning evolves (or devolves!, as the case may be).

<div>The definition for "screw" goes like this:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">"Slang for wages, salary; possibly because in some employments it was handed out in 'screwed up on paper' or because it was 'screwed out' of one's employer; it is also slang for a prison warder, from the days when the locks were operated from a screw-like movement."</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Modern definitions, while much more thorough, are, needless to say, nothing like this one. Likewise, "Screwed" is defined here as "intoxicated. A playful synonym of <em>tight</em>." Of course in a modern context these definitions seem merely quaint, but there are tons of things here that just don't exist now either.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You'll find entries, for example, with stories like that of "John o' Groats":</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">"The site of a legendary house 1 3/4 miles west of Duncansby Head Caithness, Scotland. The story is of...three Dutch brothers, came to this part of Scotland in the reign of James IV. There came to be eight families of the name and they met annually to celebrate. On once occasion a question of precedency arose, consequently John o'Groat built an eight-sided room with a door to each side and placed an octagonal table therein so that all were 'head of the table'. This building went ever after with the name of John o' Groat's House."</blockquote>

<div>At any rate, Dr Ebenezer Cobham Brewer was, as far as I can tell from his biography in the "Centenary Edition," a man who did little besides read, write and garden. The list of books he wrote or edited is astounding, beginning in 1841 (Brewer was born in 1810) with <em>A Guide to Science</em>, which went into 47 editions and sold more than 319,000 copies by 1905. He wrote books on accounting, scripture, Greek, Roman, French history, as well as a <em>Political, Social, and Literary History of Germany</em>, and near the end of his life, <em>A Dictionary of Miracles</em>.</div>
