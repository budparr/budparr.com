Hard to believe it's October, and funny to think that it was 16 years ago on Columbus Day that I moved to NYC.

I've lived on the Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Gramercy, Ft. Green and Carroll Gardens Brooklyn, and have spent an enormous amount of time in the West Village, where I also went to school at NYU, both undergraduate and graduate.

I've walked so many stretches of this city to see it as closely as possible. I buy my pickles on the Lower East Side. I shopped avidly at the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_Book_Mart">Gotham Book Mart</a> before that was more than a memory. I've been to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuyorican_Poets_Caf%C3%A9">Nuyorican Poets Café</a>, read on stage at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery_Poetry_Club">Bowery Poetry Club</a>, read a piece of my own at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB_(bar)">KGB Bar</a>, been to readings, lectures of all stripes, and held my own little debates in bars all over the city.

I met my wife at The Gingerman on 36th St. Took her to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumley's">Chumleys</a> (the former speakeasy with the hidden entrance and signed photos of the literary who's who of time past, that is sadly no longer) on our first date and to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquin_Round_Table">storied</a> Algonquin on our second.  We got engaged in Central Park (see photo), had our wedding rehearsal dinner at the restaurant in Bryant Park, and were married at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Arts_Club">National Arts Club</a> in Gramercy Park. We had three kids at NY Presbyterian Hospital.

I've worked in the World Financial Center for Merill Lynch, spent much time at the World Trade Center, commuted to New Jersey, and after a major career change from Wall Street to technology, became part of the laptop in coffee shop revolution. I've had drinks or posh meals at the St. Regis and Cipriani's; the top of the Chrysler building; stayed at The Plaza Hotel, when it was The Plaza Hotel. I've met or seen movie stars, royalty, diplomats and politicians. I've talked politics or books with some of the most incredibly bright minds one can imagine.

I've made money, gone broke, been unhappy then ecstatic. I've seen a lot, but nothing close to it all. Pretty much everything I am today is a result of being in NYC, yet to those who were born here, I'm not really a New Yorker. At least my three sons will be.
