For the past decade I’ve been a designer and developer of websites. I enjoy the constant renewal and problem solving of this work. I work with organizations and people I admire for their contributions to the world. 

I think of myself as a technologist/strategist first and a designer/developer second. But really, one wouldn't be much without the other. 

I have three children and one wife. I love roasting and brewing coffee. I’m an ambivert. I value curiosity and learning. I like challenging books. Gadget junkie. I agree that there are only two types of music.


### About the site

My wife thinks this site is boring, but my only real goal with it was to try and nail down the typography.

This site was created by scratch in a text editor using some amazingly powerful tools:

- The text editor is [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/).  
- The site's HTML is generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and its [source](https://github.com/budparr/budparr.github.io) is freely available on Github, where it is hosted using Github's [Pages](pages.github.com) service.
- It uses [Cloudflare's](https://www.cloudflare.com) powerful Content Delivery Network to make the site even faster and more secure.  
- The stylesheets were written in Sass with the help of [Sassaparilla](http://sass.fffunction.co/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).
- The type is [Mercury](http://www.typography.com/fonts/mercury-text/overview/) by Hoefler & Frere-Jones, served by that firm's [cloud.typography](http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/) service.  

I'm working on making the layout for this site into a theme. It can have a left or right sidebar or both and is fully responsive. The CSS file for the current site is ~13kb.
