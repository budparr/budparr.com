Thomas Pynchon's work has just been released as e-books. That's great news, but I'm disappointed that a full e-book catalog of a major writer wasn't released with something more like the Pottermore model. I had hoped that Rowling's approach had started a trend.

With so much in flux I'd hate to be locked into a particular reader, which, by merely releasing as an ebook to be sold from various vendors forces me to do, now. And, there wasn't any 'buy them all' option like you can do with Pottermore.

Enjoy the announcement video:
