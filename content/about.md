I am a web designer, developer and strategist working independently for nearly 15 years as Sonnet Media in New York City. My work is primarily focused on the cultural and human rights sectors. I've done work for The American Bar Association, The Royal Kingdom of the Netherlands, HarperCollins Publishers, New York University and numerous publishers, journals, and many authors. Prior to working on the web, I had a 15 year career in finance, working for Merrill Lynch, and Prudential International Investments.

I earned a Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts from New York University.

In my spare time, I run the [{static is} The New Dynamic](https://www.thenewdynamic.org/) project and [Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/the-new-dynamic/), exploring static web technologies and the “post-CMS” paradigm.

I live on the upper west side of Manhattan with my wife and three sons who are not usually as glum looking as in the photograph on the home page.
