[Trello](https://trello.com/) is the central tool I use to organize the many facets of my life and projects. While I use many other systems for managing projects and data, like [Github](https://github.com) and [Podio](https://podio.com), I find that having one place as the "dashboard" for what I need to be working on or thinking about is essential.

Trello is a blank slate to begin with, which is great, but it leaves you to figure out your own system. It's important to give it a structure and keep with that. What follows is an outline of mine, though there are many examples of basic setups on the [Trello Blog](https://blog.trello.com/).

Like any system, you only get out of it what you put into it. You need to review your dashboard daily and be active about it.

_Quick note: There are a lot of helpful bits on the [Trello help site](http://help.trello.com/), so I won't go into the basics, with one exception: Trello is structured as a collection of **boards** that hold one or more **lists**, each of which holds one or more **cards**. Cards can be single to-do type items, or entire projects themselves._

## My Structure

I may keep separate boards for individual projects or ongoing lists, but I keep one board that I call "Planning" as THE board I use to manage my daily life.

Within that board I keep the following lists:

- **Inbox**: Have a place to throw stuff so you don't have to think about it when it hits you. Try to keep empty this when you do your daily reviews.

- **Today**: This is the list that the cards on the other lists eventually flow to. When I review my boards (which is often the night before), I look at everything and ask "what do I need to work on today"?

- **TODO**: This is a list of time-sensitive actionable items that should hit my today list within the week.

- **Actionable/No Time Frame**: This is a list of things I should get done, but not necessarily this week. I try to keep this list to no more than 10 items.

- **Projects**: I work on large ongoing projects and I keep a list of the ones I'm responsible for here so that every day I see the broad list of responsibilities I have.

- **Events & Deadlines**: While I keep a separate calendar, I tend to put meetings and upcoming obligations here, so that I can take notes on things to cover in the meeting, or take notes on it. I have these show up on my other calendars so I don't feel I have to track multiple calendars.

- **Topics/Small Projects**: I keep a list of issues that I'm thinking about with notes here. Make use of checklists and attachments on cards. Sometimes they turn into actual projects, and sometimes they are just places to brain dump on a topic.

- **Reference**: This is really optional, but sometimes, like the topics list, there are issues I want to think through, so I keep them here. Sometimes items in this list can just be checklist items in one of the topics on the other list.

- **Done (or Outbox)**: Like the Inbox list, this is just a stopping place for cards before they get archived, if, for instance, they are date-based items you want to remain on the calendar, or whatever. This is optional.

While that may seem like a lot of boards, I find that the central lists: Today, Todo, are really important and the others help me keep order. Most everything ultimately flows into the Today list, with few exceptions, otherwise it probably doesn't belong on the board at all.

The important thing is to find a structure that works for you.



## Trello Resources

The key to getting the most out of Trello is getting things into it effortlessly and accessing information as quickly as possible. These items will help:


- (_indespensible_) Trello has a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello/dmdidbedhnbabookbkpkgomahnocimke) that allows you to search your Trello boards from the address bar, and add web pages to your boards. If I only used one addon, this would be it.


- [Boards for Trello](https://boardsfortrello.com/) adds your Trello boards as the blank page in Chrome and gives you access to your boards from the toolbar:


- [Paws for Trello](http://friendlyfox.es/pawsfortrello/) is an application window for your Trello boards so you can access them outside of the browser. It has native notifications, multiple windows  and quick add shortcuts as well as shows the number of cards on a list (to help you keep them limited).

- I also use Android's quick-add shortcut on my phone.

- Use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/trello) or [Zapier](https://zapier.com/zapbook/trello/) to get information from other apps into Trello automatically. IFTTT is easier to use, Zapier is more capable.




## Tips

- Email items into your board or an individual card (thanks, Dorian).

- Use Keyboard shortcuts to move effortlessly (use the "?" key to pull up a reference list).

- Use the color coded labels ("l" key, when the cursor is over a board) judiciously, though don't stress about their meaning. They're best at helping you to visually group cards (say, all personal stuff, or all client stuff, or priority stuff).

- Hit the "f" key to start filtering. You can then start typing or just hit one of the labels to show only cards with that label.

- Make the most of "Power Ups". You get one for free, three for Gold membership, and unlimited for Business membership. Some helpful ones are: Repeating Cards, Card Snooze, Calendar, Card Aging.

- Have your date-based items feed into whatever calendar you use, like [Google Calendar](http://help.trello.com/article/829-using-trello-with-google-calendar).
