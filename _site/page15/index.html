        We’re All a Little Mad: Final Thoughts on Don Quixote
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Jul 2005</span>

    <p>
Ernest Hemingway said &#8220;All good books have one thing in common - they are truer than if they had really happened, and after you have read one of them you will feel that all that happened, happened to you and then it belongs to you forever.&#8221;
<br />
</p>
<p>
I think Pappa stole that idea from Cervantes. Who better knew how literature seeps into our consciousness just as much as we let it? Who more than Don Quixote lived through the books he read, defended the honor of made up characters and, when becoming one of those characters himself championed the unseen author of his own history?
<br />
</p>
<p>
When I wrote a piece called &#8220;<a href="http://www.400windmills.com/2005/04/why_read_don_qu.html">Why Read Don Quixote?</a>&#8221; just before starting the book, I wondered if I would finish, or enjoy it or if in the end it would mean anything to me. I admitted then that I had started once and put it down. I said too in that piece that reading the <em>Quixote</em> was the result &#8220;of a seemingly inevitable collision with the book through others I&#8217;ve read.&#8221; I had no idea that <em>Don Quixote</em> is, in many ways, all about that collision. Our ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha was a great lover of books. Not only did he read a lot, his erudition amazed everyone he met, even as they puzzled over his madness. He retained so much that his books became collectively his Bible in the way that many look to theirs as a manual on how to live. But for Quixote, the <em>Gospel according to John</em> was instead maybe the Gospel according to Amad&#237;s of Gaul.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Like the parting of the Red Sea, Don Quixote&#8217;s &#8220;history&#8221; was born from the very idea that the romances he read were indeed &#8220;truer than if they had really happened.&#8221; That trueness, Don Quixote&#8217;s reality, is the most fascinating element of the story. His sanity always lay just below the surface in the same but opposite way that most of us have a little madness just below our social veneer.
<br />
</p>
<p>
I was struck around mid-way through when a boy whom Don Quixote had &#8220;saved&#8221; from a beating by his master, revealed that because of Don Quixote&#8217;s actions he was beaten even more. Quixote&#8217;s remorse was painful and I felt as though he would have passed through his sanity divide and stayed there, but ultimately he couldn&#8217;t help himself and continued on his travels. That sort of thing was a constant source of frustration and tension throughout the book. He never seemed to learn from all that happened until finally he was vanquished himself, which wasn&#8217;t just a matter of valor, but faith. When Don Quixote stopped believing in the literature, he stopped believing in himself and he died.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Right from the prologue we know that the book <em>Don Quixote</em> is about language and literature as Cervantes criticizes the methods of his peers and forebears. There are stories within the story and most every character at some point becomes someone who they are not in everyday life - everyone is a storyteller and everyone straddles the line of believing in their tales.
<br />
</p>
<p>
In terms of language, Sancho is constantly harangued by Don Quixote for his poor use of proverbs and incessant malapropisms. Interestingly, Quixote&#8217;s intolerance for poor language and circumlocution is usually met by the public&#8217;s vulgar tastes. For example, the Duke and Duchess love Sancho&#8217;s witless witticisms and always insist he keep talking despite Quixote&#8217;s protests. So while Quixote chastises Sancho, everyone else is amused and only wants to hear more, which seems to be the very same problem that Cervantes has in stamping out the romance literature of old.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Our text, putting aside for a moment that it is a translation from the Spanish, is, we are told, a translation from events that transpired in Spanish dialogue into Arabic by Cide Hamete Benengeli, which is then translated back to Spanish for the benefit of our narrator. This naturally was an area of exploration for speakers on the <a href="http://www.400windmills.com/2005/04/pen_world_voice.html">Global Quixote translator&#8217;s panel</a>. There are a lot of errors in the book and no one knows if they were intentional or not, although some suspect they were, and that becomes just one aspect of the translation. Additionally, most agree that Cervantes&#8217; wordplay is often central to enjoying the book and extracting meaning from the dialogue. I recommend Edith Grossman&#8217;s translation to anyone who thinks those elements are essential. I thought Grossman&#8217;s spare footnotes terrifically enlightened me when Cervantes used meanings that through time or translation would be lost. I imagine there are many more examples that a scholarly edition would include, but her judgement produced a balanced, readable and enjoyable novel. Given the layers of translation, a non-Spanish reader must recognize their translator as just as much a part of the book as Hamete or Cervantes himself.

Now that <em>Don Quixote</em> has sat snugly on the shelf for a couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve practically forgotten some of my earlier misgivings (that I wrote <a href="http://www.400windmills.com/2005/04/the_knight_of_t.html">about</a>). I see now why this novel is loved by so many great writers and I think the Hemingway quote says it all. I like to think, like Don Quixote or like Fabrizio in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0679783180%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0679783180%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" id="2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0679783180%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">The Charterhouse of Parma</a></em> - who was impelled to set out into the world by reading about Napoleon - that I too live richer having seen the world through the lives of my imaginary heros. <em>Don Quixote</em> is a testament to reading and a testament to believing in the imagination, even if the outside world doesn&#8217;t always get it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
I remember the novel <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0446673382%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0446673382%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" id="2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0446673382%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">A Mapmaker&#8217;s Dream</a></em>, where a hermetic cartographer draws maps of the world based solely upon the exotic tales of travelers. Fra Mauro, the mapmaker, says:
<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>
...I believed that the thoughts and impressions of all my visitors were derived from a certain actuality, at all times palpable, when in truth their remarks had quite obviously passed through the filter of their own sensibility.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />What that belief really means is that my map is a distortion. All its representation of terrain and oceans is but the revelation of how I regarded my visitors&#8217; perceptions in the first place. I now realize that the world is not real save in the way each of us impresses upon it his own sensibility. More importantly, this sensibility results from a belief in the world being a measurable whole, rather than something that extends beyond time or place.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Yet I am grateful to those who have provided me with the benefit of their illusions. They have journeyed to Venice, to this monastery, from so many distant places in order to share with me the purest of all deceptions - that of their own willingness to be entranced.
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In a way, we all have that, we are all a little crazy because we are willing to be entranced, and so was most every character in Don Quixote. I think that one thing that people miss when talking about this book is just how great every single character is. Besides maybe <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> or <em>Hamlet</em>, I can&#8217;t think of another book that makes every single character integral to the story. It&#8217;s that wholeness that gives it life and makes it so true.
<br />
</p>
<p>
For anyone who has only read the first part of Don Quixote, I say read the second. In some way that I can&#8217;t identify, particularly since they were published ten years apart, the second half completes and defines the novel as a whole and makes it so much more meaningful. <em>Vale</em>.

    <p>
**SPOILERS ALERT (I&#8217;ll try not to reveal much, but there may be spoilers here)**
<br />
</p>
<p>
As I close in with less than a quarter of the book remaining, I thought it worthwhile to collect randomly a few observations I&#8217;ve had on the second half - or third sally - of Don Quixote&#8217;s journey. Book two feels radically different than book one as the reception Our Ingenious Gentleman and his squire receive is far more peaceful than before. There is less violence and what little there is has tended to favor Quixote rather than harm him (for example the joust with the Knight of the Mirrors). The Knight of the Mirrors is an apt name, I think, because in part two there are many people disguising themselves in one way or another, such as the Knight of the Mirrors himself; Pedro who has reappeared from book one; Basilio&#8217;s death, which is the third mock suicide by blade for the sake of a love in the book as a whole, with the others being Luscinda and Camila; there is the enchanted Dulcinea, although she is only disguised by Sancho&#8217;s guile; and lastly, the Duke and Duchess, who are only in disguise in so far as their sincerity is concerned.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Sancho Panza is becoming something of a caricature of himself in book two - his subtle observations from part one have given way to strings of barely relevant proverbs and self-serving proclamations. I had long thought that the quote &#8220;there are but two families in this world, the haves and the have-nots&#8221; was attributed to Don Quixote, but on page 594 I found that line streaming from Sancho&#8217;s mouth as he reverses his loyalty to someone because they are rich and therefore have food for him:
<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>
And he showed him the pot full of geese and chickens, and seizing one of them, he began to eat with great verve and enthusiasm, saying:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;To hell with Basilio&#8217;s talents! You&#8217;re worth what you have, and what you have is what you&#8217;re worth. There are only two lineages in the world, as my grandmother used to say, and that&#8217;s the haves and the have-nots, though she was on the side of having; nowadays, Se&#241;or Don Quixote, wealth is better than wisdom: an ass covered in gold seems better than a saddled horse. And so I say again that I&#8217;m on the side of Camacho, whose pots are overflowing with geese and chickens, hares and rabbits, while Basilio&#8217;s, if they ever show up, and even if they don&#8217;t, won&#8217;t hold anything but watered wine.&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Sancho&#8217;s boldness has grown with his skepticism, which instead of showing any sense of perspicacity instead has made him seem more simpleminded. It&#8217;s confusing in a way, as both Sancho and Don Quixote have an awareness of Quixote&#8217;s madness and what is looking more and more like Sancho&#8217;s madness, but they refuse to accept any one else&#8217;s recognition of it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
The emphasis on language is also interesting here and more prominant in book two. Sancho&#8217;s bold pronouncements are usually countered by his malaprops. Malapropism is a term used to describe a person&#8217;s use of a (typically polysyllabic) word incorrectly, primarily with the effect of contradicting themselves or making them look foolish or comical. The word was coined from Mrs. Malaprop in an 18th century play called <em>The Rivals</em> by Richard Brinsley Sheridan. My handy dictionary of literary terms credits Shakespeare as using them (not called malaprops) in <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>, but I would say that Sancho&#8217;s malaprops are a prime example too.
<br />
</p>
<p>
James Wood in his essay on Don Quixote in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0374177376%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0374177376%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" class="floatimgleft" id="2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0374177376%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">The Irresponsible Self</a></em>, says that &#8220;A rough analogy of the action in the second book might go like this: Jesus Christ is wandering around first-century Palestine trying to convince people that he is the true Messiah.&#8221; That seems to me as though (and Wood does address this in a more thoughtful way) the New Testament had been written before Christ&#8217;s journey and he was only forming part two. I bring this up mostly because of the religious aspects I&#8217;ve noticed in part two. Of course, religion is a theme throughout the book because religious life and religious delineations were a significant part of life then and a part of the racial landscape. But I&#8217;m thinking more of personal terms, where for example, Sancho performs a catechism of sorts on page 515. Quixote uses biblical language to describe his journey on page 495:
<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;I know that the path of virtue is very narrow and the road of wickedness is broad and spacious; I know that their endings and conclusions are different, because the expansive, spacious road of wickedness ends in death, and the road of virtue, so narrow and difficult, ends in life, not the life that ends, but life everlasting...&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The quote above looks very much like this from Gospels of St. Matthew in the King James Bible:
<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>
7:13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: 7:14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And that, interestingly, is followed by another line appropriate to many of the people that Don Quixote encounters:
<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>
7:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But most significantly I think Quixote&#8217;s experience in the Cave of Montesinos is very much like the experiences of Galahad and Lancelot in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bookenompolic-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0140442200%2526tag=bookenompolic-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0140442200%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" class="floatimgleft" id="2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0140442200%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">The Quest for the Holy Grail</a></em>, which I read in its &#8220;original&#8221; form before reading Don Quixote. I say original as opposed to, say, Sir Malory&#8217;s version because this so-called original is much more an allegory for the quest for nearness to God than a tale of errant knights. Book two of Don Quixote is much closer to the religious aspect of the quest, where Quixote is a lancelot character, a searcher, rather than a Galahad character, who is much closer to pureness than even Quixote would give himself credit for.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Quixote&#8217;s experience in the cave could be taken straight from the <em>Quest</em>, and Dulcinea&#8217;s enchantment, as false as it is (another theme!), looks much more now like the Lady in the Lake from the Arthurian tales. None of that should come as any great surprise, but in my mind, it is the religious aspect of the quest that is most striking and I think from what I know of the ending of the book, that idea will bear out, but I&#8217;ll have to wait and see.

        Thank You for Not Reading: Essays on Literary Trivia, by Dubravka Ugresic
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 May 2005</span>

    <p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/ugresic.jpeg" style="float:left;margin-right:18px" alt="altimage" /> <strong>The Market and Ms. Ugresic</strong> <em>Thank You for Not Reading: Essays on Literary Trivia</em> by Dubravka Ugresic, Dalkey Archive Press.</p>
<p>We all have one of those friends, always ironic, quick with the comebacks and a wry opinion on just about everything. Dubravka Ugresic, one might surmise from reading her book of essays, is one of those people. The aptly named <em>Thank You for Not Reading: Essays on Literary Trivia</em> is a collection of 31 short pieces &#8211; smoothly translated from the Croation by Celia Hawkesworth&#8212;ostensibly about the state of the publishing industry.</p>
<p>I say ostensibly because <em>Thank You for Not Reading</em> is about much more than the publishing industry in all its celebrity chasing glory, it is a book with a unique perspective. Ugresic grew up in communist Yugoslavia, worked at the Institute for the Theory of Literature at the University of Zagreb, and left what is now Croatia in 1993. Today she lives in Amsterdam. Her point of view, always in sight here, is that of an intelligent woman&#8212;a writer in a narrowly spoken language&#8212;from a small country that has undergone ideological, political and calamitous change. </p>
<p>The book&#8217;s arc is from light to dark, never too dark, merely skimming the surface of a seriousness that by the end leaves the reader questioning Ugresic&#8217;s intentions. We begin with Eeyore as our mascot and are treated to a description of Joan Collins at the annual London Book Fair &quot;dressed like a quotation: in a little pink Chanel suit, with a pink pillbox hat on her head and a coquettish veil over her eyes.&quot; &quot;What does this have to do with literature?&quot; she asks. &quot;Almost nothing,&quot; she points out, and it is just this sort of trivia that has &quot;swamped contemporary literary life and become, it seems, more important than the books.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The writer who does not accept the rules of the market will simply perish . . . The world of the literary market is ruled by the producers of books, but producing books does not quite mean the same thing as producing literature.&quot;</p>
<p>With that, the premise of Ugresic&#8217;s book is settled and we are entertained with biting commentary on pitching literary agents, book blurbs, celebrity and pop culture, and The Market.</p>
<p>The word &quot;market&quot; can mean many things and it can be understood here as &quot;the publishing industry,&quot; but in my opinion, when Ugresic says market she does so with the mind of an Eastern European. I don&#8217;t mean to imply that she longs for a return to communism, indeed, as an intellectual, she seems to be stuck in the middle of two ideologies that have in her lifetime shown their ugly faces. No, I think the word market to her connotes something more like Chichikov&#8217;s trading of dead souls in Gogol&#8217;s novel, with all its metaphorical double meaning. The market she speaks of is seemingly harmless, yet opportunistic and ultimately evil. </p>
<p>It is irony that Ugresic revels in. In the essay &quot;Engineers of Human Souls&quot; she compares literature, essentially in America and Russia: &quot;The demands of the market have no ideology; they have been been cleansed of it, they are pure, desirable, wreathed in glamour and glory. What the market decides is confirmed by millions, and its moral dimension is not in question. The work is worth as much as we pay for it.&quot;</p>
<p>She says it. She knows it&#8217;s true, but we know that she doesn&#8217;t believe it. Similarly, she follows that passage with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The former communist, noncommercial cultures, particularly in Stalin&#8217;s days, must be given credit for the professionalism of the writer&#8217;s craft&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I maintain that Stalinism was a stern school of literary professionalism. Stalinism made writers into professionals, who would surely be rampaging through the international literary market now, if only they&#8217;d lived. Writers had to be professionals, it was a matter of life and death. Stalinist writers had to take great care to follow the rules of the game: the rules of socialist realism. Literature had to be comprehensible to the broad reading masses&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From there, Ugresic easily segues to contemporary commercial writers and mass producers of books, like Stephen King, that are &quot;comprehensible to the broad reading masses.&quot;</p>
<p>Ugresic&#8217;s strength is in making her point through anecdotal stories and putting context around her everyday observations. In &quot;How I Coud Have Been Ivana Trump and Where I Went Wrong,&quot; she chronicles the rise of her fellow Eastern European from small town Czech girl, national ski team member and model, to Donald Trump&#8217;s wife, businesswoman and finally celebrity writer. When the two meet, Ugresic finds &quot;her appearance somehow touching. With her exaggeratedly bleached hair, too-heavy make-up, and lips like fresh hot dogs.&quot;</p>
<p>Her point? &quot; . . . when my students ask me how one becomes a writer, I reply with complete authority: &#8216;Take up a sport and train like hell. Anything else could lead you in the wrong direction.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>While she&#8217;s good at inferring from the obvious, many of her earlier essays cover material that is too obvious or trite to even the most casual observer of the publishing world or pop culture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The blurb is one of these devices, only apparently innocent. If words such as fantastic, astonishing&#8230;and so on accompany the name of some well known person on the back of your own book, entrance to the world of references is almost guaranteed. And the well known person need not be a writer. Bill Gates and Madonna are more effective promoters than Gunter Grass. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of pop icons scattered throughout the book, including Oprah, Monika Lewinsky, O.J., the apparent media-influenced families of the Columbine victims, and the &quot;mega-death&quot; of Lady Di. The juxtaposition of death, celebrity, and media occur often here.</p>
<p>This obsession with the symbols of mass culture might be best explained in her essay &quot;The Role of Kirk Douglas in My Life&quot; where she describes growing up watching imported American movies and says &quot;I believe that we outdid the film critics of the time in our knowledge of the names of Hollywood actors,&quot; only to find out later that Kirk Douglas, who she had received a letter from as a young girl, had became an author:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was overcome by a sudden vague sadness&#8230; And then the sadness became an inner protest. The protest came from the sudden sense of my historical moment; the thought that everyone in the world has become a writer, literature was not a mountain peak which I had been trying to climb for years driven by the romantic notion that it belonged only to the persistent and dedicated, and that it was therefore only literary mountain-climbers who earned the right to write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we see this is a very personal book. Her contempt of popular culture rises from her own seriousness of craft and intellect contrasted with the easy ride to literary fame that the aura of celebrity has given to so many. The Hollywood images of her youth crashing with reality.</p>
<p>The earlier, lighter stories unfold into observations of an exiled writer: the suspect motivations of the writing and intellectual community in her home country, the corruption and malfeasance of her new so-called democratic government, and the sense of homelessness that even a self-willed exile feels. It is in this later part of the book that Ugresic really excels, by giving us a very real sense of her unique perspective. But it is here too that she fails, because we have been so long riddled with her cynicism, by now we don&#8217;t know what is true.</p>
<p>In many of her essays, Ugresic includes herself with those she damns, as if it&#8217;s okay to snarl when doing it in the mirror. But that does not justify all of her conclusions. For example, Ugresic takes on (without naming names, necessarily) the writers and intellectuals she would be a part of. In &quot;War is War, but Intellectuals Are Only Human,&quot; she says that the &quot;tragic disintegration of Yugoslavia was extensively covered by the media.&quot; True. But then she says that &quot;Miles of film and tons of paper were used up. Heaps of documentaries, films, books, photographs were produced, even souvenirs . . . &quot; She is still correct, but she goes on, and in discussing intellectuals, filmmakers and journalists as one massive lump of media, in this situation seems more sarcastic than thoughtful.</p>
<p>It seems that she is determined to leave no area of public or literary life untouched, but you only need to think of two people positively involved in the Balkan conflict, Susan Sontag and Jean-Luc Godard, both representing the opposite of everything Ms. Ugresic condemns, to see how thin a shield cynicism can be.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that she gets the media&#8217;s hold on culture wrong. In one of her best wry watercooler moments, she quotes a proponent of a &quot;Turn off Your TV Month&quot; as saying &quot;Who knows whether our campaign will have the same significance this time as it had last year, when we had fantastic media coverage.&quot; To her credit, she takes a wide swath of heavy topics such as globalization, war, culture, and a market driven publishing industry and treats them with enough levity to make the book entertaining. But it sometimes feels like a barrier, the way we tell jokes at a funeral when what we really want to do is scream our bloody heads off.</p>
<p>Toward the end, Ugresic returns again to her original theme: &quot;In the global market we are all sellers, even when it does not seem that way. Everyone automatically holds out his business card, everyone strives to be heard even when he has nothing to say&#8230; The only acceptable aesthetic choice that remains for people of good taste is silence.&quot;</p>

<strong><a href="http://www.joycesociety.org/fw_frame.html" target="_blank" title="Gotham Book Mart">Gotham Book Mart</a></strong>
<br />16 East 46th Street (btwn 5th/Madison)
<br />212 719-4448
</p>
<p>
Simply the best bookstore in the city. Personal service, a rich history and a deep collection of serious literature. Both new and used books, including classics, poetry (probably the best in the city), many author-specific collections. The ultimate in browsing, even if the location is too midtowney to suggest from the outside that it has character. Gotham used to be the only place you needed to go to find literary journals. Since their recent move one block away - but seemingly a million miles from their old location - their journal collection has thinned. Hopefully that will change as they get settled in. See my previous <a href="http://www.chekhovsmistress.com/2004/08/wise_men_have_f.html" target="_blank" title="article on Gotham Book Mart">article</a> on Gotham for more information.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://threelives.com/">Three Lives &#038; Company</a></strong>
<br />154 West 10th Street (at Waverly Place)
<br />212-741-2069
</p>
<p>
Named in part for a Gertrude Stein book, Three Lives is a bookstore's bookstore. It really is a perfectly beautiful store. The owner has excellent taste and you can always find something interesting and new from some small presses as well as the majors. There are no used books here, so don't go looking for any bargains. Most but not all of the books at Three Lives are trade paperbacks. The poetry section is smallish, but there is a travel section, a New York section, staff picks and a selection of books on writing. The store hosts readings by popular authors, information about which you can find on their web-site. (p.s. Don't go to Three Lives without stopping by Joe, The Art of Coffee, for a near perfect ristretto espresso. Joe is around the block at the corner of Waverly and Gay.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mercer Street Books</strong>
<br />206 Mercer St. (at Bleeker)
<br />212 505-8615
</p>
<p>
This is one of my favorite used bookstores. They have a solid selection of fiction in hard and paper-back, literary criticism, classics and poetry. It's proximity to New York University is probably responsible for its good selection of criticism and other serious stuff; be sure to check out the recent arrivals table. They also have a selection of old literary journals, which are fun (if such things fit your idea of fun) to pick through randomly.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.mcnallyrobinsonnyc.com/">McNally Robinson</a></strong>
<br />50 Prince St. (between Lafayette and Mulberry)
<br />(212)274-1160
</p>
<p>
McNally Robinson is related to but independent of the Canadian company of the same name. It's great to see new bookstores opening and McNally Robinson appeared just last December in neighborhood nowadays called Nolita. They have pretty a active event calendar and a &#8220;tea house.&#8221; They have a small selection of literary journals, and a decent emphasis on good literature for a general bookstore. In fact, they have a &#8220;local poets&#8221; section set aside (of course this is New York City, so that could, practically speaking, be quite large, but it isn't. They also arrange their fiction into regions, which is unique and welcome. The selection is not huge, but appears to be thoughtful.
</p>
<p>
Update: I had previously reported that McNally Robinson had shrunk their literary selection, but after speaking to the folks there, I am assured that the space has grown, so I've retracted my earlier comment.
</p>
<p>
From Mcnally Robinson's buyer: &#8220;...the shelf space devoted to Lit has only grown since we opened...Literature happens to be squeezed into a physically tighter area in the more valuable upstairs real estate, but there are more books on the shelf than before. Initially I didn't believe it either.  Then I got a tape measure out. Interesting how we humans perceive space.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.stmarksbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp">St. Marks Bookshop</a></strong>
<br />31 Third Ave. (at E. 9th)
<br />212 260-7853
</p>
<p>
Fairly mainstream bookstore, but St. Marks does have a good selection of literature/culture and art books that to some degree reflect the neighborhood. Probably the second best place, behind Gotham, for literary journals. The poetry and fiction sections are by no means comprehensive, but well chosen. There are no used books here. (p.s. If you go to St. Marks, you must stop by the Mud truck at the Astor Place subway for one of the best cups of coffee in the city.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.housingworks.org/usedbookcafe/index.html">Housing Works Used Book Cafe</a></strong>
<br />126 Crosby Street (at Houston)
<br />212 334-3324
</p>
<p>
The UBC is a great store for browsing and finding bargains. You can find a book and relax in the cafe. The environment is warm, the building is classic and there's a pretty wide selection of literature, always very cheap. Also, your money is well spent here, because 100% of the profits go to Housing Works, a non-profit organization that provides housing, healthcare, job training, advocacy and many other services for homeless New Yorkers living with HIV and Aids. That alone is worth doing some shopping there. They are having a sale this weekend (Jan 8/9) too, when everything is 30% off.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.strandbooks.com/home/">The Strand Annex</a></strong>
<br />95 Fulton Street (3 blocks east of Broadway)
<br />212 732-6070
</p>
<p>
The Annex is much better for browsing than its parent. A fairly deep used fiction selection (a lot of hardbacks) and much more space between the shelves to maneuver (the main Strand store can get very cramped and crowded).
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://labyrinthbooks.com/StoreFrame.htm">Labyrinth Books</a></strong>
<br />536 West 112th Street (btwn. Brdwy/Amsterdam Ave.)
<br />212 865-1588
</p>
<p>
Described as a store of scholarly, literary &#038; cultural books, Labyrinth serves the Columbia U. smarties. This bookstore has an amazing literature collection, including poetry, but major authors only. You will sometimes find what you are looking for discounted 25%, but don't count on it. The real bargains are at the <a href="http://www.labyrinthbooks.com//main.asp?">sale annex</a>, which is only on-line, but where the prices tend to hover around $5-6. Some of the books from the annex, however, do find their way to Labyrinth's staircase even though that inventory doesn't seem to change much.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.strandbooks.com/home/" target="_blank" title="The Strand">The Strand</a></strong>
<br />828 Broadway (at 12th St.)
<br />212 473-1452
</p>
<p>
18 Miles of Books. Overated, but probably the best place to sell your used books. Great for browsing and with enough effort you may find some bargains, but there are tons of (only) slightly discounted books. The Strand does have one specialty that is unparalleled as far as I know and that is their reviewer's copy section, tucked away in the basement. These are all new and recently published books at 1/2 off of their original price. Don't expect to find anything hot there though.
</p>
<p>
The Strand also has a kiosk at 5th Ave and 60th for a quick fix on your way to Cipriani's for a $19 glass of scotch.
</p>
<p>
<strong>12th St. Books</strong>
<br />11 East 12th St.
<br />212 645-4340
</p>
<p>
A smallish all used bookstore with a mixture of hard and paper-backs and a variety of subjects. Never a first stop, but worth a drop by if you're at the Strand (which is close by).
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.murderink.com/Search.bok?category=Signed+Firsts" target="_blank" title="Murder Ink">Ivy Books/Murder Ink</a></strong>
<br />2488 Broadway (btwn W. 92nd/W. 93rd)
<br />212 362-8905
</p>
<p>
Murder Ink claims to carry every mystery book in print and I think that speaks for itself. Next door, Ivy carries a mixture of new and used literature. It's a small, quaint, homey shop (I think it was in the Visa ad with Kevin Bacon) that is always worth a stop.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Biography Bookshop</strong>
<br />400 Bleecker St. (at 11th St)
<br />212 807-8655
</p>
<p>
The best thing about BB is its location on a picturesque street in the village and the sale table outside. It seems that I always find a bargain there.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.192books.com/" target="_blank" title="192 Books">192 Books</a></strong>
<br />192 Tenth Avenue (at 21st  St)
<br />212 255.4022
</p>
<p>
Okay, so the name is not too creative, but it's a pleasant stop with a small but well chosen selection of literature and non-fiction and an art space. There are bargains to be had on a small cart toward the front, but most of the inventory consists of new paperbacks. The bookstore serves at the pleasure of its owners who also own an art gallery nearby, choose the books and set up the impressive readings the store hosts.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://turtlepoint.com/lenox/" target="_blank" title="Lenox Hill Bookstore">Lenox Hill Bookstore</a></strong>
<br />1018 Lexington Avenue (btwn. 72nd/73rd)
<br />212 472-7170
</p>
<p>
Yeah, so it's on the Upper East Side. It's still a nice bookstore. Very Pleasant with a selection of the latest editions in literature and general non-fiction. Pretty mainstream stuff for the most part, but they have started their own &#8220;Chapbook Series&#8221; publishing and a &#8220;First Editions Club&#8221; if that's your sort of thing. I consider myself a reader, not a collector, but I do like to see bookshop owners venturing out and doing interesting things.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.shakeandco.com/index.php" target="_blank" title="Shakespeare &amp; Co.">Shakespeare &#038; Co.</a></strong><strong>
<br /></strong>939 Lexington Ave. (at 69th)
<br />212 570-0201
</p>
<p>
137 E. 23rd St. (at Lexington)
<br />212 505-2021
</p>
<p>
716 Broadway (at Washington Pl.)
<br />212 529-1330
</p>
<p>
There are more Shake &#038; Co. locations than I've listed. The one on broadway tends to have somewhat subversive collection, but otherwise all of the stores are fairly mainstream. Some sell textbooks, most sell magazines, but light on the journals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Crawford Doyle</strong>
<br />21 E 90th St
<br />212 289 2345
</p>
<p>
Ah, another Upper East Sider. Whenever I brush off my passport to go to that side of town I try to stop by Crawford Doyle. It's small and sells mostly new paperbacks and general non-fiction, but they do have an interesting collection of rare books to look at. It's always fun for an occasional browse.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://coliseumbooks.com/" target="_blank" title="Coliseum Books">Coliseum Books</a></strong>
<br />11 West 42nd St. (Btwn 5th/6th Ave across from Bryant Park)
<br />212 803-5890
</p>
<p>
Coliseum is overrated. They seem to be trying to be all things to all people. Now they have a cafe and a not terribly helpful staff. The selection is spotty (my impression is that it was better before they moved to their new location) and doesn't seem to be too serious anywhere. i.e. I never find myself saying...&#8220;I'm looking for X book, maybe I should stop at Coliseum first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.posmanbooks.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp" target="_blank" title="Posman Books">Posman Books</a></strong>
<br />9 Grand Central Terminal (Vanderbilt &#038; 42nd Street)
<br />212-983-1111
</p>
<p>
Posman used to be a good bookstore. They used to be right next to NYU and carried textbooks and an interesting selection of some serious stuff that you might not find elsewhere. Now they are very general, they sell a lot of paperbacks and serve GCT commuters, not book lovers.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.churchill-books.com/">Chartwells Books</a></strong>
<br />55 East 52nd St. (In the arcade of the Park Avenue Plaza building between Park &#038; Madison Avenues)
<br />212 308-0643
</p>
<p>
This store is dedicated to books by and about Winston Churchill. Much of their inventory is on-line, but the smallish store is pleasant and quiet with a small collection of literature and things like military books or foreign affairs, mostly in hardbound.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Westsider Used &#038; Rare</strong>
<br />2246 Broadway (at 80th)
<br />212 362-0706
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few opportunities to buy used books around the Upper West Side. There are a lot of books being sold on tables on the street and there are little bookstores tucked away where you wouldn't know they are there, such as Gryphon Bookshop. One of them (the name escapes me) finally gave up and closed its dusty doors, but there are still others fighting the good fight. Westsider is one of them. Books stacked to its very tall ceiling (it has a loft, so the main floor is two stories), it's a fun place to pop into once in a while. As with most used bookstores, you never know what you will find. Unfortunately, the fiction section seems to be all paperbacks, which are not appealing to me because they've already used a good part of their limited life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Biases:</strong>
</p>
<p>
This list is not meant to be a comprehensive list of stores. Here are my biases:
</p>
<p>
First, these are only Manhattan shops, where, for the moment, I hang my hat and therefore buy my books. There are great bookstores that I know about in Brooklyn and upstate New York and the Berkshires, but then things start to get out of hand.
</p>
<p>
This list is mostly concerned with literature and not special interests. In NYC there are bookstores that sell nothing but cookbooks, there are gay bookstores like the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore, there are travel bookstores, like the Complete Traveller (with an amazing used and rare travel book collection), stores that specialize in rare collectible books like Bauman's or Argosy, children's bookstores like Books of Wonder, art bookstores, and so on. Again, things would get out of hand if I were to try and write about all of them, and literature is my only interest in terms of the pastime of browsing for and buying books. I've also only listed independent stores here because no one needs me to tell them about Barnes &#038; Noble (although they do have a good annex on 18th st, their original store I think, where they have text books and such).
</p>
<p>
My last bias is that I really really like to find cheap used hardcover books; they last longer and tend not to have reader annotations (which I avidly add myself). I buy fiction, criticism and poetry. These stores are the places I go to find those things. If you know of a place worth checking out, I'd love to hear about it.

    <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2005</span>

    <p>
Do you recall the parable in Kafka's The Trial?
</p>
<blockquote>
Before the Law stands a door-keeper. To this door-keeper there comes a man from the country who begs for admittance to the Law. But the door-keeper says that he cannot admit the man at the moment. The man, on reflection, asks if he will be allowed, then, to enter later. 'It is possible,' answers the door-keeper, 'but not at this moment.' Since the door leading into the Law stands open as usual and the door-keeper steps to one side, the man bends down to peer through the entrance. When the door-keeper sees that, he laughs and says: 'If you are so strongly tempted, try to get in without my permission. But note that I am powerful. And I am only the lowest door-keeper. From hall to hall, keepers stand at every door, one more powerful than the other...
</blockquote>
<p>
Now substitute &#8220;Publishing&#8221; or &#8220;Mainstream Media&#8221; for &#8220;the Law.&#8221;

<p>
Now throw all of that out because the <a href="http://lbc.typepad.com/blog/">Lit-blog Coop</a> is here!

<p>
These are fascinating times indeed in the lit-blog world. Mark Sarvas (famously known as TEV) has married Talent and Innovation to do something good in the world of literature: Promote great books (four per year, to be exact) through the lit-blogging community.

I am delighted to be involved. This represents a departure for me in terms of thinking more about contemporary fiction than I have in the past, but it feels important, experimental and just plain cool.
