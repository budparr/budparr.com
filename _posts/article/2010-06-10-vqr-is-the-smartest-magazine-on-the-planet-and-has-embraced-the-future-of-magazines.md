<a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-10-at-10.06.17-AM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-256" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-10-at-10.06.17-AM.png" alt="" width="158" height="225" /></a>I only started reading <a href="http://www.vqronline.org/">The Virginia Quarterly Review</a> (VQR) after they won the National Magazine Award in 2006. It's a big fat journal, beautifully produced and smartly edited. The magazine is squarely aimed at a general audience with a wide variety of interests, including world affairs and the arts. For instance, the Spring issue this year is subtitled "Graveyard of Empires: Obama's Afghanistan" with journalist's accounts from the field, but also poetry by Tadeusz Rózewicz (including a terrific introduction by Ed Hirsch: "...a poet of dark refusals, hard negations"). There are also essays by Edward Falco, "An Elliptical Essay on Violence" and Michael David Lukas, "Workshopping the Next Generation of American War Literature."

But what makes VQR <em>really</em> smart these days is that they have seen the future of magazines, and that future is "EPUB." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epub">EPUB</a> is the current standard for ebooks, or more precisely, the "format for reflowable digital books and publications."

The current attempts by magazines to port their print editions into a glossy format for tablet computers (let's move on and recognize that iPad is merely the first of these) is lame and misguided. Let's face it: <a href="http://www.zinio.com/">Zinio</a>, the primary app for presenting digital versions of print magazines, is anemic, and won't exist in its current form for very long. Individual apps, like Wired, with some level of interactivity and whiz bang, may work when they get that interactivity and whiz bang down, but production costs will likely favor only certain types of magazines.

Granted, at the moment the EPUB standard leaves a bit to be desired, but if you've never seen a hard copy of VQR, which is beautiful, you wouldn't feel like you were missing much. And the EPUB standard is improving. It will soon bridge the gap between print and digital in the most important senses and some of the sentient qualities lost from print will be offset by the many capabilities that digital brings to the table. It's clear that the VQR team has invested a lot of effort on design and this issue is better produced than a lot of books I've seen (publishers take note, please).

In announcing their decision to publish on the iPad specifically, VQR said on their <a href="http://www.vqronline.org/blog/2010/06/08/vqr-ipad/">blog</a>:
<blockquote>It may seem a bit narrow to produce a version of the publication solely for the iPad—rather than supporting the Kindle, Nook, or Sony Reader—but it was a decision that we came to after a lot of study and consideration. It is important to us that we distribute VQR in a manner that is open, unencumbered by the limitations of digital rights management and patents. And it is important to us that the photographs in our pages be reproduced without a significant loss in quality. This leaves only e-readers that support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">the ePub standard</a>, which rules out the Kindle. The Nook and the Reader have only crude black-and-white displays, leaving the iPad as the only candidate that meets our criteria. Apple is slated to release their eBooks software for the iPhone and iPod Touch, which will make our digital edition of the magazine available on any of the one hundred million portable Apple devices in use today. We hope to support more devices in the future as they embrace the ePub standard and full-color images.

..."[We've] been around for 85 years. We take the long view. The open, simple, accessible, indexable, archivable ePub format is clearly the best option for us and for our readers."</blockquote>

For a reader, this is fantastic news. I've been a magazine addict my entire adult life, often subscribing to thirty or more publications at a time. However, keeping them creates piles and piles of paper, virtually ensuring that a good portion of them will go unread. Living digital just means one more file that I can search and store and return to as often as I like. In the future, when printing costs aren't a factor, particularly for low-print run magazines and journals , they will be priced more affordably.

Lit journals in particular should embrace EPUB immediately. I love you all, but paying $12 for every issue of every journal packed to the gills with writers most people have never heard of has value only to the culture at large, but rarely to actual readers (as my friend Richard Nash points out "your slush-pile are your readers"). There is no greater planned obsolescence than a lit journal, yet there has never been a more opportune time to bring literature and ideas into the greater cultural conversation. Web sites are great, but leave out the immersive qualities that ebooks promise for reading things that require sustained attention. VQR's Spring edition is priced at $3.99, which seems more than fair to me given its 305 pages of content and its print subscription (for four issues) of $32 per year. If you are one of the millions with an iPad—a new one gets sold every three seconds, they say— buy a copy of VQR. You won't be sorry.

<em>addendum: </em><a href="http://twitter.com/Weegee"><em>Kevin Smokler</em></a><em> points out on Twitter that the (excellent and forward thinking) journal </em><a href="http://www.electricliterature.com/"><em>Electric Literature</em></a><em> has already published in EPUB, a fact I should have known because I mentioned them some time ago when they published an iPhone app. The 2nd issue has Lydia Davis and Colson Whitehead, among others, the current issue includes Aimee Bender. Buy that too! </em>
