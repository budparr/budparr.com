  <div class="entry-content prose">

    
    <p>This morning Google announced - re-announced - that they will launch their foray into e-book selling as soon as this summer. Chris Palma, Google’s head of Strategic Partner Development, spoke this morning at the offices of Random House as part of panel discussion hosted by Publishers Weekly on the future of book publishing.</p>

<p>This is an idea Google has let percolate for quite a while, Palma said, but only now with the proliferation of devices and major players do they feel it is finally the right time to throw their hat into the e-book ring.</p>
<p>Google Editions will build upon Google's existing Book Search product: <a href="http://books.google.com/">http://books.google.com/</a> Search and access books just the way you do now, only soon you'll be able to buy your books directly from Google (or via an Online retailer - Powell's was the example used) and add them to your google (Gmail) account for reading on any device.</p>
<p>Google's mantra is buy anywhere, read anywhere. That also is what most of the e-book players say, but Google means it. They see their audience not as the millions of people who have bought Kindles or iPads, but the entire universe of 1.8 billion internet users and Google's reader will simply be a Web browser.</p>
<p>Their books will exist solely in "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">the cloud</a>," which may have some interesting implications: namely, there's no file to download. When you read a Google e-book, you are reading a cached file online (yes, you will have offline access thanks to the newest version of HTML 5).</p>
<p>And if there's no file to download, there's no file to share or steal. Palma made the point that if a user wanted to share a Google e-book they'd have to share their entire Google account, which could include Gmail, your Web history, and so forth, with the reasoning that few are likely to do this. This may or may not be foolproof though Palma indicated that even if a hacker got into an account they'd be accessing one book only without the ability to do any pirating.</p>
<p>This setup also may also be an answer to Digital Rights Management issues. I wonder - the question wasn't broached - if their method would lead to the possibility of a user relinquishing their right to a book and turning that right over to someone else, for a limited time or permanently. This seems possible because there's no file to replicate, but remains to be seen or even discussed, to my knowledge. I do think the ability to share will sooner or later be a matter of consumer demand.</p>
<p>While Palma touted the ability for readers to search across their entire library or to share their margin notes with friends or any buyer of the same book, one of the audience wondered how the search function will affect which books get exposure. The answer of course, as it always is with Google, is relevance, leaving a gaping question about which books get sold. Thinking about how Google search works, it would seem that the latest edition would get the most exposure at any given time, completely independent of each version's relative merits.</p>
<p>
<p>Much of today's discussion was industry focused and centered around the three major players: Google, Amazon, and Apple. One panelist, <a href="http://www.blackplasticglasses.com">Evan Schnittman</a> from Oxford University Press, went into the relative strengths and weaknesses of each and the various models they operated under.</p>
<p>Google's approach of using an HTML, browser-based reader (books will be in e-pub format) may leave a lot desired for a lot of readers as it's been my experience so far that apps are nicer, generally speaking. Google's focus is on the less exciting aspects of e-books - search and annotation, rather than the reading experience - which might limit their impact to certain types of books, though just how the reader will perform remains to be seen.</p>
<p>It seems to me from listening to this panel that this is Amazon's game to lose, and with over a million iPads out in the wild in the first month alone, both Google and Apple, despite their differences, about which Palma made some vague references, will drive the e-book market in the future. Well, we'll see, but that was how I came away feeling from today's talk.</p>
<p>The entire discussion was taped by C-Span, so may be available on their Website soon.</p>
