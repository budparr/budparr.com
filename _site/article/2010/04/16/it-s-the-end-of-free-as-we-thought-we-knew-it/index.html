  <div class="entry-content prose">

    
    <p>When I worked on Wall Street the common wisdom was “fade the press” meaning that when Time and Newsweek, etc all led with stories of doom for the economy then it was time buy. This was an old and well worn principle, yet not one to ignore.</p>

<p>Could it be that within ten months of when “Wired Magazine’s” Chris Anderson published his book <em>Free: The Future of a Radical Price</em> that the pendulum is swinging? There’s much debate over whether or not old media establishments will survive charging for content (the iPad will not save them, the mantra goes) because “content wants to be free.”</p>

<p>Lots of people outside of media, including Marc Andreessen, the founder of Netscape - which was a great thing to create but is notably no longer in existence - say old media is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/06/andreessen-media-burn-boats/">“shortsighted at best”</a> trying to charge money for content.</p>

<p>Yet, Andreessen’s Ning network - another great thing whose story is not yet final - just announced that they are no longer free. And what’s more, they are, according to this <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/15/nings-bubble-bursts-no-more-free-networks-cuts-40-of-staff/">TechCrunch article</a>, kicking out all their previously existing free networks unless they start paying. That seems like a drastic and shortsighted move to me.</p>

<p>The ever-brilliant <a href="http://37signals.com/">37 Signals</a> gang doesn’t believe in “free” as a business concept, but they’ve always offered a free version of their applications (indeed, the ability to move back and forth between free and paid versions as conditions warrant is what has kept me as a customer all these years).</p>

<p>The blog Gigaom has a relatively new and terrific paid site, <a href="http://pro.gigaom.com/">Gigaom Pro</a>, for more advanced research, Twitter is desperately trying to monetize without charging directly (a plan which I seem to be the only one who will think fail)</p>

<p>And truth is, I love reading some newspapers in the iPad app version and would pay for it if it were really well designed so as to give me control over how I consume the paper. Yes, it’s true there’s tons of great content on the Web, but even the best designed Web-based papers have lots and lots of noise (ads and links everywhere) and do a pretty poor job of taking into account what I may have read already, what sections I tend to read, what stories I’m following, etc. (though solving these issues may or may not be a Web vs app question).</p>

<p>I think that while content in general tends toward free there is room for the right content presented well that is worth paying for; no one has found the right model yet, but corner people long enough and they’ll figure something out. “Old Media” is nothing if not cornered. Don’t discount the need to make sense of all the noise and what that might be worth; we just have to figure out where value lies.</p>

<p>So maybe free’s just another word for nothing left to lose (now managing to get two song title cliches into a single post) or the price to entry for players who can’t demand a market price. Then price becomes, like Veblen goods, sort of (these are goods that, for psychological reasons, greater price infers greater status or perceived value), an actual mechanism of value. It’s early yet and bringing prices back depends on most all of the players to start charging, an interesting problem for game theorists.</p>
