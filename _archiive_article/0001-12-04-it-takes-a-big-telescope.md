I recently dismissed a New Yorker blog post ("<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/01/the-book-of-the-future-sliced-and-diced.html">The Book of the Future, Sliced and Diced</a>", Jan. 22, 2013) on Twitter with the following quote by Jorge Luis Borges:
<blockquote>"I have dipped into books of aesthetics, but I had an uncomfortable feeling that I was reading the works of astronomers who had never looked at the stars. They were writing about poetry as if poetry were a task, and not what it really is, a passion, and a joy."</blockquote>
This is particularly apt because the post I was responding to quoted several new players in publishing technology characterizing books as "...an amount of knowledge that I feel good about finishing" and "a bag of words," stripping away their essence, the shared consciousness a book of any kind represents. We could probably put a stake in the ground on the day Apple introduced the iPhone  - or perhaps the iPad  - and say that was the day the technologists became publishers. So what's so bad about this?
