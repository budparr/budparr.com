    <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>Thomas Pynchon’s work has just been released as e-books. That’s great news, but I’m disappointed that a full e-book catalog of a major writer wasn’t released with something more like the Pottermore model. I had hoped that Rowling’s approach had started a trend.</p>

<p>With so much in flux I’d hate to be locked into a particular reader, which, by merely releasing as an ebook to be sold from various vendors forces me to do, now. And, there wasn’t any ‘buy them all’ option like you can do with Pottermore.</p>

<p>Enjoy the announcement video:</p>

    <blockquote>A. It’s great for me. That’s my attitude. I don’t write for the reader. I’m working for the text, the object coming into existence. It makes its demands. Then, like a child you’ve raised, it goes off into its business, not mine.</blockquote>
<p>From a brief interview with the inimitable, infinitely intelligent 88 year-old, William H. Gass at the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/a-champion-of-the-book-takes-to-the-ipad/">NY Times</a> on the publication of his iPad only book-length essay, <em>Abstractions Arrive: Having Been There All the Time. </em></p>

<p>My long-held belief is that books in any form are all about the text so why shouldn’t they be in any form, or perhaps Mr. Gass is saying by his action that the form should suit the text.</p>

<p>At any rate, significantly, he makes a claim that may take a while to bear fruit:</p>
<blockquote><em>What effect does the Internet have on serious novelists?</em>

<em></em>A. It frees up writers from their publishers. Novels are being squeezed out of the culture. On the Internet, you can have them in their full efflorescence. Anyone who wants them — all five or six of you — can have them. That will purify the writers. It will become plain that they are only writing to a select group. So if you’re going to do it, you’ll have to do it well.</blockquote>
<p>I’m running off to download <em>Abstractions Arrive: Having Been There All the Time </em>because the only thing  I love more than that title is brining together two forms of art in one place, as well as the fact that his book <em>Reading Rilke - Reflections on the Problems of Translation</em> is a personal favorite.</p>
