    <p>If, like me, you sat horrified as Colin Powell so obviously lied to the world about WMDs in Iraq back in 2003, you knew there was a heavy dose of politics at work there. Making explicit what we more or less understood, Fulton Armstrong, a former U.S. Intelligence Officer, writes, in a letter to the editor of <em><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/aug/19/cia-and-wmds-damning-evidence/?pagination=false">The New York Review of Books</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>When we on the National Intelligence Council finally got a full read of the National Intelligence Estimate on WMDs, after its publication, a couple of us expressed grave reservations about the fatally weak evidence and the obsessively one-sided interpretation of what shreds of information it contained. (We were not told at the time that “Curveball” was a solitary source of obviously questionable credentials, nor that contradictory evidence was actually suppressed from the intelligence collection and dissemination process.) One colleague said it was clearly a paper written to provide a rationale for a predetermined policy decision to go to war. When I challenged the lack of evidence and the lack of alternative explanations, including forcing the questions raised by the INR into a lowly footnote, one of the WMD-promoting NIOs leaned forward and bellowed: “Who are you to question this paper? Even <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>The New York Times</em> agree with us.” The irony was complete: previously respected reporters, spoon-fed by Bush administration officials, were now being used to provide cover for the NIOs’ similar compromise in accepting the administration’s view.</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Powers, who wrote the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/may/27/how-they-got-their-bloody-way/">article</a> (about a book by Robert Jervis on the topic), replies, beginning:</p>
<blockquote>Fulton Armstrong’s important letter states as fact something Americans have been resisting for sixty years—that presidents tell the CIA not only what to do, but what to say. By Americans I do not mean only ordinary citizens puzzling over intelligence flaps every few years, but observers thought to be sophisticated, like professors, senators of long experience, foreign policy professionals, and reporters for serious newspapers. Armstrong describes the reality about as plainly as I have ever seen it done in his letter explaining the source of error in the CIA’s insistently wrong estimate of the progress of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in its purported effort to develop weapons of mass destruction.</blockquote>
<p>One takeaway from this exchange (upon reading it in its entirety ) is that not much has changed in terms of the underlying problems. Whenever I begin to think I should be less cynical about politics and the media, I come across something like this. Cynicism never goes out of style.</p>

Having no vested interest in MFA programs or the 'state of fiction,' I was free to be amused by Elif Batuman's fairly far reaching article in the <em><a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n18/elif-batuman/get-a-real-degree#fn-ref-asterisk">London Review of Books</a></em> taking Mark McGurl to task for his defense of MFA programs. The setup is this: Batufman is a PhD and McGurl is a PhD discussing what I suspect is regarded as a rather lowly space in academia - which explains why terms like "intradiegetic-homodiegetic narration" seem to me out of place. Nonetheless, the essay touches on the serious subject of the affect MFA programs have on generations of writers and what we as readers come to expect of them.

In his book <em>The Programme Era: Postwar Fiction and the Rise of Creative Writing</em>, McGurl takes what I think is the minority position defending the MFA, saying that programme writing has produced "as rich and multifaceted a body of literary writing as has ever been." Batufman is rightly critical of him and the programmes - admitting from the outset that she's no fan of the writing that comes out of them - but comes off, in the beginning, amusingly pedantic by pointing out the historical precedents of this or that sort of writing that McGurl left out. She says "It might not be true that you have to ‘know the rules before you can break them’, but knowing the rules can save you from certain pitfalls, like thinking you’re being revolutionary when you aren’t."

Her point, I think, is something that I know anecdotally to be true, that MFA students don't read and don't have a sense of precedent, the affect of which is stultifying. She says...
<blockquote>I think of myself as someone who prefers novels and stories to non-fiction; yet, for human interest, skilful storytelling, humour, and insightful reflection on the historical moment, I find the average episode of <em>This American Life</em> to be 99 per cent more reliable than the average new American work of literary fiction.</blockquote>
Don't laugh that comment off, because I think there's a lot of validity to it, though I wish she wouldn't have brought "Reality Hunger" in the essay (if only because of exhaustion). MFA programs serve a great purpose - essentially professionalizing fiction writing - but they are not where the best writing is coming from. Yet...
<blockquote>McGurl has an explanation for why programme writing seems so unexciting and unspecial. It’s a weird explanation. ‘As with the disappearance of the .400 hitter in professional baseball’, so technical excellence has produced an ‘optical illusion of encroaching mediocrity: being the dominant figure in Shakespeare’s or even Pound’s time was, by comparison to today, easy as pie’. In other words, the programme era has produced so many books as good as <em>The Red and the Black</em> that we don’t notice them anymore.</blockquote>
I find this, as Batufman does, implausible, but I don't think the answer is, as she seems to imply, only having PhD programs for literature because MFA doesn't provide enough grounding.

At any rate, that's just my bit, but read the whole terrific essay at <em><a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n18/elif-batuman/get-a-real-degree#fn-ref-asterisk">LRB</a> </em>because there's much more depth there<em>. A<span style="font-style: normal">nd  check out Batufman's </span>The Possessed<span style="font-style: normal">. I haven't picked it up yet, but it came very highly recommended to me by someone who really ought to know. </span></em>

    <p>The movie “Nine” is based on a play that is in turn based on the film “8 1/2.” Despite an all-star cast led by Daniel Day-Lewis and a stunningly beautiful production it manages to fall flat on its face. If one wanted a film example of <a href="http://www.robkapilow.com/wmigreat.shtml">“What Makes it Great”</a> with a bastard interpretation of an earlier great work, this is it. “Nine” is a perfectly soulless film. Avoid except for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>But one good thing came of an otherwise wasted evening. While searching around to see if I was the only one who loathed “Nine,” I found <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091223/REVIEWS/912239996">Roger Ebert’s</a> review and learned this bit that I missed by not going to film school (or, whatever):</p>
<blockquote>Fellini's great films are essentially musicals. Like most Italian directors of his generation, he didn't record live dialogue and sound. He depended on dubbing. On a set, he usually had an orchestra playing, and asked his actors to move, not in time with the music, but "in sympathy." Everyone in a Fellini film evokes an inner body rhythm. Then there's Rota's music itself, my favorite soundtracks. I could watch a Fellini film on the radio.</blockquote>
<p>That makes perfect sense now that I know it, and nowhere would the concept be more clear than in “8 1/2.”</p>

        Joyce to Ibsen, 1901
      </a>

    <p>James Joyce wrote to Henrik Ibsen when Joyce was nineteen years old and Ibsen in his seventies and at the end of his career. Joyce had managed to publish a review —his very first formal publication — of Ibsen’s play <em>When We Dead Awaken</em> a year earlier and, to his great surprise, Ibsen responded: “I have read or rather spelled out a review in <em>The Fortnightly Review</em> by Mr James Joyce which is very benevolent and for which I should greatly like to thank the author if only I had sufficient knowledge of the language.” This began a three year correspondence between the two.</p>

<p>According to Joyce’s biographer Richard Ellmann, Ibsen’s response “fell upon him like a benison at the beginning of his career. He had entered the world of literature under the best auspices in that world…Before Ibsen’s letter Joyce was an Irishman; after it he was a European.”</p>

<p>At this time Joyce had been writing, but it was well before he published any of his own work of fiction, poetry or drama. Ibsen’s influence is clear in <em>Portrait</em>, yet in an earlier essay “Drama and Life” and the following letter it appears that Ibsen’s influence is as an artist as well. Understanding Joyce’s view of himself as an “artist” is critical to reading his work.</p>

<p>“…the artist forgoes his very self and stands a mediator in awful truth before the veiled face of God.”</p>

<p>Joyce translated his own words from English to Norwegian. Here is the letter:</p>
<blockquote>To Henrik Ibsen
March 1901

<em>8 Royal Terrace, Fairfield, Dublin </em>

Honoured Sir: I write to you to give you greeting on your seventy-third birthday and to join my voice to those of your well-wishers in all lands. You may remember that shortly after the publication of your latest play, <em>When We Dead Awaken</em>, an appreciation of it appeared in one of the English Reviews — <em>The Fortnightly Review</em> — over my name. I know that you have seen it because some short time afterwards Mr William Archer wrote to me and told me that in a letter he had had from you some days before, you had written, 'I have read or rather spelled out a review in <em>The Fortnightly Review</em> by Mr James Joyce which is very benevolent and for which I should greatly like to thank the author if only I had sufficient knowledge of the language.' (My own knowledge of your language is not, as you see, great but I trust you will be able to decipher my meaning.) I can hardly tell you how moved I was by your message. I am a young, very young man, and perhaps the telling of such tricks of the nerves will make you smile. But I am sure if you go back along your own life to the time when you were an undergraduate at the University as I am, and if you think what it would have meant to you to have earned a word from one who held as high a place in your esteem as you hold in mine, you will understand my feeling. One thing only I regret, namely, that an immature and hasty article should have met your eye rather than something better and worthier of your praise. There may not have been any wilful stupidity in it, but truly I can say no more. It may annoy to you to have your works at the mercy of striplings but I am sure you would prefer hotheadedness to nerveless and 'cultured' paradoxes.

What shall I say more? I have sounded your name defiantly through the college where it was either unknown of known faintly and darkly. I have claimed for you your rightful place in the history of drama. I have shown what, as it seemed to me, was your highest excellence — your lofty impersonal power. Your minor claims — your satire, your technique and orchestral harmony — these, too, I advanced. Do not think me a hero-worshipper — I am not so. And when I spoke of you in debating societies and so forth, I enforced attention by no futile ranting.

But we always keep the dearest things to ourselves. I did not tell them what bound me closest to you. I did not say how what I could discern dimly of your life was my pride to see, how your battles inspired me — not the obvious material battles but those that were fought and won behind your forehead, how your wilful resolution to wrest the secret from life gave me heart and how in your absolute indifference to public canons of art, friends and shibboleths you walked in the light of your inward heroism. And this is what I write to you of now. Your work on earth draws to a close and you are near the silence. It is growing dark for you. Many write of such things, but they do not know. You have only opened the way — though you have gone as far as you could upon it — to the end of 'John Gabriel Borkman' and its spiritual truth — but your last play stands, I take it, apart. But I am sure that higher and holier enlightenment lies — onward.

As one of the young generation for whom you have spoken I give you greeting — not humbly, because I am obscure and you in the glare, not sadly, because you are an old man and I am a young man, not presumptuously nor sentimentally — but joyfully, with hope and with love, I give you greeting.</blockquote>

        VQR is the Smartest Magazine on the Planet and Has Embraced the Future of Magazines
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2010</span>

    <p><a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-10-at-10.06.17-AM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-256" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-10-at-10.06.17-AM.png" alt="" width="158" height="225" /></a>I only started reading <a href="http://www.vqronline.org/">The Virginia Quarterly Review</a> (VQR) after they won the National Magazine Award in 2006. It’s a big fat journal, beautifully produced and smartly edited. The magazine is squarely aimed at a general audience with a wide variety of interests, including world affairs and the arts. For instance, the Spring issue this year is subtitled “Graveyard of Empires: Obama’s Afghanistan” with journalist’s accounts from the field, but also poetry by Tadeusz Rózewicz (including a terrific introduction by Ed Hirsch: “…a poet of dark refusals, hard negations”). There are also essays by Edward Falco, “An Elliptical Essay on Violence” and Michael David Lukas, “Workshopping the Next Generation of American War Literature.”</p>

<p>But what makes VQR <em>really</em> smart these days is that they have seen the future of magazines, and that future is “EPUB.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epub">EPUB</a> is the current standard for ebooks, or more precisely, the “format for reflowable digital books and publications.”</p>

<p>The current attempts by magazines to port their print editions into a glossy format for tablet computers (let’s move on and recognize that iPad is merely the first of these) is lame and misguided. Let’s face it: <a href="http://www.zinio.com/">Zinio</a>, the primary app for presenting digital versions of print magazines, is anemic, and won’t exist in its current form for very long. Individual apps, like Wired, with some level of interactivity and whiz bang, may work when they get that interactivity and whiz bang down, but production costs will likely favor only certain types of magazines.</p>

<p>Granted, at the moment the EPUB standard leaves a bit to be desired, but if you’ve never seen a hard copy of VQR, which is beautiful, you wouldn’t feel like you were missing much. And the EPUB standard is improving. It will soon bridge the gap between print and digital in the most important senses and some of the sentient qualities lost from print will be offset by the many capabilities that digital brings to the table. It’s clear that the VQR team has invested a lot of effort on design and this issue is better produced than a lot of books I’ve seen (publishers take note, please).</p>

<p>In announcing their decision to publish on the iPad specifically, VQR said on their <a href="http://www.vqronline.org/blog/2010/06/08/vqr-ipad/">blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>It may seem a bit narrow to produce a version of the publication solely for the iPad—rather than supporting the Kindle, Nook, or Sony Reader—but it was a decision that we came to after a lot of study and consideration. It is important to us that we distribute VQR in a manner that is open, unencumbered by the limitations of digital rights management and patents. And it is important to us that the photographs in our pages be reproduced without a significant loss in quality. This leaves only e-readers that support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">the ePub standard</a>, which rules out the Kindle. The Nook and the Reader have only crude black-and-white displays, leaving the iPad as the only candidate that meets our criteria. Apple is slated to release their eBooks software for the iPhone and iPod Touch, which will make our digital edition of the magazine available on any of the one hundred million portable Apple devices in use today. We hope to support more devices in the future as they embrace the ePub standard and full-color images.

..."[We've] been around for 85 years. We take the long view. The open, simple, accessible, indexable, archivable ePub format is clearly the best option for us and for our readers."</blockquote>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_271” align=”alignleft” width=”150” caption=”Some of my litmag collection (click for larger)”]<a href="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/litmags.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-271" src="http://ageofsand.com/assets/img/uploads/2010/06/litmags-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>For a reader, this is fantastic news. I’ve been a magazine addict my entire adult life, often subscribing to thirty or more publications at a time. However, keeping them creates piles and piles of paper, virtually ensuring that a good portion of them will go unread. Living digital just means one more file that I can search and store and return to as often as I like. In the future, when printing costs aren’t a factor, particularly for low-print run magazines and journals , they will be priced more affordably.</p>

<p>Lit journals in particular should embrace EPUB immediately. I love you all, but paying $12 for every issue of every journal packed to the gills with writers most people have never heard of has value only to the culture at large, but rarely to actual readers (as my friend Richard Nash points out “your slush-pile are your readers”). There is no greater planned obsolescence than a lit journal, yet there has never been a more opportune time to bring literature and ideas into the greater cultural conversation. Web sites are great, but leave out the immersive qualities that ebooks promise for reading things that require sustained attention. VQR’s Spring edition is priced at $3.99, which seems more than fair to me given its 305 pages of content and its print subscription (for four issues) of $32 per year. If you are one of the millions with an iPad—a new one gets sold every three seconds, they say— buy a copy of VQR. You won’t be sorry.</p>

<p><em>addendum: </em><a href="http://twitter.com/Weegee"><em>Kevin Smokler</em></a><em> points out on Twitter that the (excellent and forward thinking) journal </em><a href="http://www.electricliterature.com/"><em>Electric Literature</em></a><em> has already published in EPUB, a fact I should have known because I mentioned them some time ago when they published an iPhone app. The 2nd issue has Lydia Davis and Colson Whitehead, among others, the current issue includes Aimee Bender. Buy that too! </em></p>

<p><em>p.s. point to explore: How will subscription models work in EPUB?</em></p>
