title: What Do You Do When You Sit and Listen?

What do you do when you sit and listen to music or to someone read? The mind has a difficult time taking in images and sound at the same time, so the one or the other becomes a distraction. The reader's facial expression, or with music, perhaps you marvel at the player's technical skill instead of wholly taking it in. Even reading a book there's a minuscule element, no matter how lost we may get in the narrative, that we are holding an object and reading words on a page and our back may be sore or our nails need clipping. Even more difficult with poetry because we can't waste any words getting into the groove of things. This is why I always read poetry aloud. But even then.

Cut to a different topic and think for a second if you've ever seen the media of literature and video combined smartly, so that one does not become merely a distraction for the other. I can think of only rare instances when this works. Videos of readings, which are just a 'couldn't be there' or saved for posterity thing, but not really of interest on their own. Then there's some neat animations to accompany poetry I've seen. But then the animations take over the poetry, and that's not good. The poetry is cheapened that way.

Today I read Christina Mengert's review at <a href="http://www.constantcritic.com/christina_mengert/the-last-4-things/">The Constant Critic</a> of Kate Greenstreet's <em>The Last 4 Things</em>. Mengert begins with an interesting observation:
<blockquote>A few years ago, I had the pleasure of hearing Kate Greenstreet read from her first book,<em>Case Sensitive</em> (Ahsahta 2006). It struck me, at the time, how much her reading style conveyed the sense of thought in real time, as opposed to language that has been permanently crystallized and is now being rehearsed. The poems, in her mouth, carried a certain elusive feeling of spontaneity. I wondered if the poems on the page felt quite so alive, and was forced to admit, upon reading them, that while they did feel alive in a way, it seemed an inescapable quandary that once locked into the page, a poem felt, well, fixed.</blockquote>
Read the rest of her <a href="http://www.constantcritic.com/christina_mengert/the-last-4-things/">review</a>, please, for a more in-depth look on how well the poetry works.
