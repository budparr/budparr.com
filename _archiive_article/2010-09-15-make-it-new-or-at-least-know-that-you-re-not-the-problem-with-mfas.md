Having no vested interest in MFA programs or the 'state of fiction,' I was free to be amused by Elif Batuman's fairly far reaching article in the <em><a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n18/elif-batuman/get-a-real-degree#fn-ref-asterisk">London Review of Books</a></em> taking Mark McGurl to task for his defense of MFA programs. The setup is this: Batufman is a PhD and McGurl is a PhD discussing what I suspect is regarded as a rather lowly space in academia - which explains why terms like "intradiegetic-homodiegetic narration" seem to me out of place. Nonetheless, the essay touches on the serious subject of the affect MFA programs have on generations of writers and what we as readers come to expect of them.

In his book <em>The Programme Era: Postwar Fiction and the Rise of Creative Writing</em>, McGurl takes what I think is the minority position defending the MFA, saying that programme writing has produced "as rich and multifaceted a body of literary writing as has ever been." Batufman is rightly critical of him and the programmes - admitting from the outset that she's no fan of the writing that comes out of them - but comes off, in the beginning, amusingly pedantic by pointing out the historical precedents of this or that sort of writing that McGurl left out. She says "It might not be true that you have to ‘know the rules before you can break them’, but knowing the rules can save you from certain pitfalls, like thinking you’re being revolutionary when you aren’t."

Her point, I think, is something that I know anecdotally to be true, that MFA students don't read and don't have a sense of precedent, the affect of which is stultifying. She says...
<blockquote>I think of myself as someone who prefers novels and stories to non-fiction; yet, for human interest, skilful storytelling, humour, and insightful reflection on the historical moment, I find the average episode of <em>This American Life</em> to be 99 per cent more reliable than the average new American work of literary fiction.</blockquote>
Don't laugh that comment off, because I think there's a lot of validity to it, though I wish she wouldn't have brought "Reality Hunger" in the essay (if only because of exhaustion). MFA programs serve a great purpose - essentially professionalizing fiction writing - but they are not where the best writing is coming from. Yet...
<blockquote>McGurl has an explanation for why programme writing seems so unexciting and unspecial. It’s a weird explanation. ‘As with the disappearance of the .400 hitter in professional baseball’, so technical excellence has produced an ‘optical illusion of encroaching mediocrity: being the dominant figure in Shakespeare’s or even Pound’s time was, by comparison to today, easy as pie’. In other words, the programme era has produced so many books as good as <em>The Red and the Black</em> that we don’t notice them anymore.</blockquote>
I find this, as Batufman does, implausible, but I don't think the answer is, as she seems to imply, only having PhD programs for literature because MFA doesn't provide enough grounding.

At any rate, that's just my bit, but read the whole terrific essay at <em><a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n18/elif-batuman/get-a-real-degree#fn-ref-asterisk">LRB</a> </em>because there's much more depth there<em>. A<span style="font-style: normal">nd  check out Batufman's </span>The Possessed<span style="font-style: normal">. I haven't picked it up yet, but it came very highly recommended to me by someone who really ought to know. </span></em>
