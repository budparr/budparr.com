  <p>Another find while packing (see my previous post on <a href="http://budparr.posterous.com/take-the-scenic-route-to-knowledge-on-brewers"><em>Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</em></a>) is Bob Gold’s <em>A Jazz Lexicon</em> from 1964. My copy is signed “To the Richardson All-Stars - Richie, Johnnie, Jon &amp; Brooke - with love, Bob Gold 7/23/64” A quick look on the internet and some of my other jazz books gave me no clue to who those guys were but the inscription gives it a nice sense of authenticity and begs the history of the book; how it might have found it’s way from someone in the Richardson All-Stars to a used bookstore in Brookyn, where I bought it.</p>
<div>This dictionary is for 20th Century slang from the jazz set. I found a letter to the editor of the New York Review of Books by the author on the use of the word "hep:"</div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">Your recent correspondent, Cal Kolbe Nossiter, in attempting to correct Philip Rahv's nominal use of "hip" merely proliferates the error by identifying the term "hip" as a variant of "hep." Anyone familiar with the jazz scene (or anyone familiar with my recent dictionary of jazz slang, A Jazz Lexicon) knows that the word has always been "hip," and that "hep" is hopelessly square.</blockquote>
<div>For instance, "pork chop"</div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote">[prob. from jazzman's approval of both; according to jazzmen, current c. 1900-c 1917, obs. since; see also BARRELHOUSE, GULLY-LOW, LOWDOWN] Slow, earthy blues music. Oral evidence only.</blockquote>
<div>To "collar the jive" was a phrase used by Cab Calloway and part of general slang earlier in the century to mean "to understand and fee rapport with what is being said; to be in the know; to be hip. c1935 jive term."</div>
<div>Like the <em>Brewer's Dictionary</em>, it's tempting to write these words off as quaint, particularly much of the drug-culture related slang, but here especially they represent a history, one with sociological resonance, as Gold points out in his introduction: "...So we get a people in rebellion against a dominant majority, but forced to rebel secretly, to sublimate, as the psychologist would put it--to express themselves culturally through the medium of jazz, and linguistically through a code, a jargon..."</div>
<div>And because much of the language from the early jazz era was spoken, its presence here is all the more remarkable. As much as I love my lovely found hardback copy, if there were ever a case for the digitization of books, having this now out-of-print history of a special set of words is an acute one.</div>
