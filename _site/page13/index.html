    <p><img style="float: left;margin-right: 18px" src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/twkarsh.jpg" alt="Tennessee Williams" /> Whither the poor typewriter whose few remaining acolytes hoard ribbons and spare parts. Frankly, there’s no way my wife would let me clang away at a typewriter anyway – solitude is hard enough to come by without the click-click-clacking to wake the kid.</p>

<p>I do a lot of writing on a cheap (paper!) notebook and a soft <a href="http://www.staedtler.com/Mars_Lumograph_gb.Staedtler?ActiveID=2213">pencil</a>, but at some point every story begs for the spit and polish of type. That presents some problems for me because I make my living working on the computer, read the paper on the computer, read blogs, and so on and all those things are just a click away, and each of those clicks has many more clicks. You know of what I speak?</p>

<p><img style="float: right;margin-left: 8px" src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/Screenshot_6.jpg" alt="Tennessee Williams" /> I once <a href="http://chekhovsmistress.com/index.php/article/mac_the_new_typewriter_for_writers/">wrote</a> about Macs being the new typewriter. That’s when I had a Powerbook, which has the smoothest keyboard of any computer known to man. Now I use a MacBook, which is more comfy because it’s smaller and cheaper. The keyboard takes a bit more heft than its double-the-price sibling, but I’ve grown use to it.</p>

<p>But what’s the good of a keyboard if it’s forever leading you away from the glorious path of writing? None, I tell you. I know! So this is what I’ve done:</p>

<p>Macs allow you to set up users. Each user has their own log-in and profile – it’s really very much like being on a separate computer. I set up my alter-ego writer guy profile with parental controls so that I can only access a couple of applications:</p>

<p>1) <a href="http://www.bartastechnologies.com/products/copywrite/">Copywrite</a></p>

<p>Copywrite is billed as “project management for writers,” which it is, but I can’t say that I use it so elaborately. I primarily use it because it just gives you a blank page with few formatting options, full screen writing, and “versioning,” an invaluable feature because I like to freeze one version (without having to save a new file) before making substantial edits. It does have a lot of other features, like categories, etc. but I don’t use those. I just write with it. I do like having all my documents in front of me if I want to switch what I’m working on, which is an obvious difference between a program like this and, say, that devil’s child, MS Word.</p>

<p>2) Safari Web browser, also with parental controls set so that I can only access one Web site: <a href="http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/">Merriam-Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary</a></p>

<p>That’s it. I can write. I can look things up in the dictionary, and I can print. I am my own parent and I’ve put myself on restriction. It may seem a little silly, but I even write in a Courier font, which in a way is a reminder that I’m supposed to be writing as though on a typewriter; that means write forward – not writing over what I’ve just written.</p>

<p>p(small). <em>While I’m mentioning writing programs, I should mention that I use <a href="http://www.marinersoftware.com/sitepage.php?page=85">MacJournal</a> for day-to-day writing, such as blog posts or anything else relatively short when I just need to be one second away from creating a new document. Again, the biggest feature here is that there’s no formatting and all your documents are in front of you instead of opening new ones. <a href="http://www.blue-tec.com/ulysses/">Ulysses</a> is another I’ve used, but seems to have too many features for my purposes.</em></p>

        The Art of Indulgence: Notes on Witold Gombrowicz’s Bacacay
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Aug 2007</span>

    <p><img src="/assets/img/uploads/Bacacay-Cover.jpg" class="image-shadow" style="float:left;margin-right:18px" alt="bacacay" /> <br />
<br />
First published in 1957 in Poland, Bacacay is a collection of twelve short stories by Witold Gombrowicz (1904-1968), one of the major European literary figures of the 20th century.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.&#8221;</p>
&mdash; from Oscar Wilde&#8217;s <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Impulses drive the stories of Witold Gombrowicz&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/097639507X/?tag=bookenompolic-20"><em>Bacacay</em></a>, where characters abandon themselves wholly to their temptations like children who can&#8217;t stop acting up, even after getting into trouble, pushing their parents&#8217; limits while surely knowing their punishment will worsen. In &#8220;Lawyer Kraykowski&#8217;s Dancer&#8221; a brief incident (where the lawyer K humiliates our protagonist) becomes the impetus for obsessive stalking, growing in intensity and inevitability of conflict, until at one point the lawyer confronts his nameless haunter with frustrated threats of a beating, only to be met with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I was unable to speak. I was happy. I received it into myself like a communion, and I closed my eyes. In silence I merely bent over and offered my back. I waited &#8211; and experienced some of those perfect moments known only to one who truly has but few days ahead of him.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That last sentence vaguely reminds me of the kind of statement you might find Marcel Proust having made, and while their writing is entirely dissimilar, I think both Proust&#8217;s and  Gombrowicz&#8217;s willingness to penetrate the psyche farther than most puts these writers in a shared light, as well does the centrality of details in their work. The most subtle story in Bacacay is &#8220;A Premeditated Crime.&#8221; Here a lawyer travels to visit a man on business, only to find that he has just died. The lawyer becomes suspicious of the family and grows paranoid with every new piece of evidence, facts folding in on themselves until there is no logical conclusion other than murder. He finally pushes the dead man&#8217;s son to confess, only to realize at that moment there was no crime:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I realized that I gone too far, that I had gotten up to a little too much mischief &#8211; and, in deep waters, tired, exhausted by so much effort, so many faces made, I suddenly became a child, a helpless little boy, and I had a wish to confess to my big brother my mistake and the trouble I had caused.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You see,&#8217; I said, and my lips were a little out of control, &#8216;there&#8217;s a certain stumbling block here&#8230;a certain obstacle &#8211; of a purely formal character, as it happens &#8211; nothing of significance. The things is&#8217; &#8211; I already had my hand on the door handle &#8211; &#8216;that actually the body shows no signs of asphyxiation. Physically speaking &#8211; he wasn&#8217;t asphyxiated at all, but rather died of an ordinary heart attack. 	The neck, you know, the neck!&#8230;The neck was untouched!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Gombrowicz&#8217;s writing speaks so well for itself, doesn&#8217;t it) Here, the dead man&#8217;s neck becomes a central point of the story, and it is that treatment which is part of Gombrowicz&#8217;s art, dwelling on a detail about which our perception changes later in the story. In &#8220;A Premeditated Crime&#8221; as often happens in his stories, even the minor characters are maddened to the point of absurdity; so much so that you feel closed in, surrounded and helpless in this world Gombrowicz created, grotesque but actually very representative too of real life.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Dinner at Countess Pavahoke&#8217;s&#8221; a fashionable &#8220;meatless&#8221; dinner becomes orgiastic while the narrator, an outsider grateful at first to be there, is quietly appalled as the others get carried away with the cauliflower soup:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The baron accompanied her gallantly, bent over his plate, slurping and smacking his lips with all his might &#8211; and the old marchioness did her best to keep up, chewing and swallowing huge mouthfuls, evidently worried they would take her plate away before she had eaten the best morsels!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This extraordinary, sudden image of guzzling &#8211; I cannot put it otherwise &#8211; of <em>such</em> guzzling, in <em>such</em> a house, this awful transition, this diminished seventh chord, shook the foundations of my being to such an extent I was unable to restrain myself and I sneezed.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s humor in the sneeze, but also pretext for discoveries important to the story. As pretext, it&#8217;s weak, but easily written off to the quirky nature of Gombrowicz&#8217;s writing. Here again, the cauliflower soup becomes central (in ways I won&#8217;t reveal) and the tale becomes wildly symbolic of the brutality of privilege and class differences, and perhaps how stifling privilege can be, without ever sacrificing the story to be told &#8211; or the opportunity to take things a bit too far &#8211; as when in &#8220;The Events on the Banbury&#8221; the ship&#8217;s captain says: &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget, Mr. Smith, that independent of the punishment the guilty party should eat the eye that was poked out. Nautical customs require it.&#8221; </p>
<p>While nearly all of Gombrowicz&#8217;s stories are suffused with sensuality, many carry their character&#8217;s sexuality and sexual tension close to the surface, often uncomfortably so (remember too that most of these stories were written around the 1930&#8217;s). On the Banbury, a ship doomed to mutiny, the stormy force of open seas grow more fierce along with the crew&#8217;s sexual tension until, inevitably, release comes at the end. Earlier, while the seas are calm, boredom reigns but madness is never far from the surface. The protagonist, Mr. Zantman (a name that may carry connotations of a fish, appropriate here, since he never intended to be on the Banbury in the first place, but <em>swam</em> out to the ship looking for his intended ship) alternates between observation, insinuation and repulsion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Recently I had noticed that the sailors were performing bizarre movements with their torsos; specifically, as they bent over their rags they would suddenly lean on their hands, stiffen their legs and arch their backs, just like certain earthworms do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I did not ask anyone for an explanation. I put it down as a &#8216;novel way to pass the time.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, in reporting what he sees as a &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; on board, Zantman says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re all thinking about the same thing. You have a yen for goodness knows what, and I&#8217;m in the way &#8211; I&#8217;m a hindrance, isn&#8217;t that the case? &#8211; my modesty is a hindrance. That&#8217;s why everything around here either fawns or threatens, peeps or mocks; that&#8217;s the reason for the constant importunings and the fact that there&#8217;s only one unchangin thought &#8211; oh, one unchanging thought!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/030012368X/?tag=bookenompolic-20"><em>A Guide to Philosophy in Six Hours and Fifteen Minutes</em></a>, Gombrowicz writes &#8220;Philosophy begins to deal with consciousness as something fundamental. Imagine an absolute night, with a single object. If this object does not encounter a consciousness capable of sensing its existence, then it does not exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the story &#8220;Adventures&#8221; our protagonist falls into the ocean from his ship and is picked up &#8211; and held captive in what becomes more submission than imprisonment &#8211; by a &#8220;white black man&#8221; on a yacht. He is put into a &#8220;glass bubble the shape of an egg&#8221; and is tossed to drift in the sea. The second time this black man captures him, he is put into a steel sphere to be plunged to the bottom of the ocean. &#8220;And so I was to be the only living creature who would experience the gentle thud of the sphere against the ocean bed&#8230;The only one who would know absolute darkness, deadness, despair.&#8221; In the pitch blackness of his &#8220;tomb&#8221; his &#8220;individuality peeped out from that awful underwater abyss so differently from what it had been like in the light of day.&#8221; &#8220;Adventures&#8221; my favorite story in <em>Bacacay</em> grows more outrageous, yet inevitably ends up every bit as circular as the protagonist&#8217;s initial driftings.</p>
<p>There is much made of Gombrowicz&#8217;s use of the grotesque, potentially alienating readers who would find upon reading him a master of psychological drama, humor and pathos. I have no idea what sort of literature Gombrowicz had exposure to in his young years while writing these stories, but there&#8217;s so much here that is reminiscent of Wilde, Poe, Wells and others. I bet that if Gombrowicz were American (or English, and so on) rather than Polish his name would be every bit as famous as those authors. </p>

        The People’s Act of Love, by James Meek
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jan 2007</span>

    <p><em>“Could we not say of all such examples that… the monstrous always excites wonder.”</em>
<br />
      - Longinus, On the Sublime<br /><br /><br />
While at one of my favorite bookstores, <a href="http://threelives.com/" title="Three Lives and Company">Three Lives and Company</a>, “The People’s Act of Love” came up. Several of us chimed in enthusiastically and I reminded myself that this was one of the (many) books I never managed to write about last year. So here I attempt amends if for only because I think you will enjoy the book. Last year word got out that Johnny Depp would be bringing The People’s Act of Love to film, which seems both appropriate and daunting. Modern audiences can stomach just about anything, but a book that includes castration and cannibalization might be hard to translate with, er, taste. Nontheless, the book, which was longlisted for the Booker, has a cinematic flair and is well worth reading before the film is released, reportedly in 2009.
Primarily set in the remote Siberian village of Yazyk during the tumultuous years after the 1917 Russian revolution, “The People’s Act of Love” tells the calamitously converging stories of four people: One is Mutz, an officer in a Czech military unit  - led by a murderous sociopath - who is caught up in another country’s civil war. Mutz is long overdue for going home and well past believing in the means of his superior. The independent Anna Petrovna (incidentally, the name of a character in Chekhov’s first play, Platonov) is a mysteriously out of place woman whose purpose for living in the town is unknown except for one other person. And then there’s Balashov, leader of an Angelic religious sect who believes the only way to be close to God is to eschew all opportunities for fornication, that is, physically remove the possibility.
All of these characters live in a tense coexistence with their motivations veiled until Sarin arrives, literally walking in from upper Siberia with a man’s severed hand in his pocket. Sarin was a student who lost his youth and the woman he loved to revolution and has set out in the world to deliver the People, he believes, to the truth.  His arrival, which coincides with the death of a Shaman being held captive, is the catalyst for tensions to explode. The novel is built upon these characters and the collision of their individual philosophies.
James Meek, who’s written two other novels and was a foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union during the ‘90s, has researched this book well. He tells us in an afterward that many of the novel’s elements are a matter of historical yet widely unknown fact, which is interesting given their fantastical and violent nature. To tally the many heinous acts in “The People’s Act of Love”  - severed hands, toes, scrotum, thumbs, liver, etc. - would seem to me to miss the point, but it’s hard to resist as they add up and we begin to wonder if we’re not at a campfire listening to ghost stories. Closer to the point though, is the moral impetus behind these monstrous acts. It is a time of war and a time of revolution, a time when ugly terrible things become ordinary.
Meek poses questions through his characters: Is love a good reason to kill? Is there a difference between one who kills as a sociopath and one who kills for religion or patriotism, or love? “…Is there any cause which would justify a man butchering and eating his companion in the wilderness?” one character asks, adding, “who raises the companion for that purpose, like a farmer fattening a hog?” Does the question change when “the fate of the world rested” on this man, if he “is the will of the people. He’s the hundred thousand curses they utter every day against their enslavement.”? “To hold such a man,” he continues, “ to the same standards as ordinary men would be strange, like putting wolves on trial for killing elk…”
The other side of that questions is absolute pacifism and here idealistic brutality meets angelic, or perhaps stoic passivity. In this lovely passage, Balashov explains his journey toward God and a new life:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;I walked for hours, trying to be as quiet as possible and trying to move deeper into the forest. It was a warm night. I curled up on a bed of last year&#8217;s leaves between two tree roots and went to sleep. I woke up from a nightmare just when it was getting light. I had dreamed the events of the battle...as the shells began to explode I felt as if I was being bitten by some small, vicious animal, from within, as if it was just about to burst through my skin. I stood up with a shout in a pattering of falling leaves and pulled off my vest and ran my hands over my body. There was no new mark, not even a graze. I took off my boots and the rest of my clothes and sat naked on the root, trying to find the wound I was sure was there. I found nothing. In my heart I was not surprised because I did not feel as if I had lost anything, blood or flesh. It felt more as if I had gained something I should not have, which had not been there before. I had seen the best part of the two hundred comrades and their horses cut down like grass in a few minutes, and I had escaped without a cut. I should have been on my knees, for days, thanking God for his mercy. But I did not feel saved. I felt filthy inside, as if my soul would never be clean again, be there ever so much fasting and prayer, and a weight which would never let my soul float free of blind killing.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>When a man who has lived through battle and chosen a monastic life is faced with violence, what does he do? Can he go against the nature of man? Meek opens the book epigraphically with these words of the writer Andrei Platonov: “Busy remaking the world, man forgot to remake himself.” If this quote stands before the book as a challenge of meaning, then where does a man who so wholly and irrevokably remade himself fit? If this were a different novel - perhaps one much longer and written by a Russian - we might emerge with an attempt at more full understanding (which, for something along those lines I point you to Mesa Selimovic’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDeath-Dervish-Writings-Unbound-Europe%2Fdp%2F0810112973%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1169185051%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=bookenompolic-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">“Death and the Dervish”</a>), but Meek stops short trying to answer these questions. Maybe the demands of the story, or an editor, left ideas on the cutting room floor. Still, that is only a qualm with what the book could be and not with what it is, which is an enjoyable, even if horific and dismal, story written in fluid prose. If its gruesomeness pulls us in, the moral complexity of the characters is what makes the story memorable. As testament, I’ll say that I wrote this piece a full year after reading the book, having but a few notes. Much of the story and characters are as vivid in my mind today as they were when I read the book last year.</p>

        Why You Should Buy Fair Trade: The Coffee Book, by Nina Luttinger and Gregory Dicum
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2006</span>

    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1595580603%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1595580603%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002"><img src="http://chekhovsmistress.com/images/uploads/1317.cover.jpg" alt="image" width="190" height="190" style="border: 0;float:left;padding:0 8px 0 0" /></a> In 1777 Frederick the Great issued a Coffee and Beer Manifesto, proclaiming “It is disgusting to notice the increase in the quantity of coffee used by my subjects, and the amount of money that goes out of the country in consequence…this must be prevented.” Ultimately, when the government found they couldn’t prohibit coffee drinking, they monopolized coffee roasting to the point that commoners could no longer afford it, resorting to things like barley, chicory, corn and dried figs in its stead. And so goes the history of coffee: the people love it, the powerful want to control it or get a piece of the action.
Written by Nina Luttinger and Gregory Dicum, she a sustainable business consultant, he a writer, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1595580603%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1595580603%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002"><em>The Coffee Book</em></a> traces the common thread of “Kaveh,” as it was called during the days of the Ottoman Empire, from thousands of years ago to today as a politically charged drink and profitably exploitable trade. Readers will find little on the cover to indicate so, but The Coffee Book has a decided point of view. In describing the growing popularity of coffee in 20th century America, Luttinger and Dicum say…</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Indoors, away from the rhythm of the seasons, the new America increasingly moved to the rhythm of machines. Here, coffee was the ideal drink: it gave that kick you needed to spend sixteen hours tightening screws on a mind-numbing, dangerous factory floor or pounding away at a keyboard. Coffee has always been the perfect compliment to dehumanizing industrialization.&#8221;
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, there’s little sign of that impassioned reverence for the beverage often found in <a href="http://jimseven.com/?p=228" title="books">books</a> for coffee lovers. That’s because <em>The Coffee book</em> is not so much about coffee the drink, but coffee the bean, the powerful drug, profitable commodity and social elixir.
Yet there is passion here. In a world where we consumers are indeed away from “the rhythm of the seasons” and more specifically away from the origins of the products we buy, <em>The Coffee Book</em> is a whole-hearted attempt to connect us with an understanding of just how far those little beans travel before they make it into our mugs, often cultivated through the back-breaking toil of an underpaid worker equally disconnected from the end user of his labor’s produce, who may pay as much for one latte as he or she makes in a day.
Part of the problem is that coffee “cherries,” as they are called in their early stages, are grown in far away and often poorer countries. To get to our tummies in the form of a cup of joe they potentially travel through a network of growers, mills, intermediaries, government run marketing boards, exporters, importers or brokers, traders, roasters, distributors and then a cafe or other outlet. Most every player along the way takes a cut and each has some degree of pricing power that ultimately disfavors the farmer because the growing process takes a long time and is difficult to synchronize with market prices.
To complicate this scenario, there are various ways to cultivate coffee beans and in an attempt to meet marketing demand - to the tune of 15 billion pounds of green coffee per year - many growers have resorted to industrial scale plantations and “technification” methods, which produce higher yielding varieties that can be grown in the sun, but also result in a greater environmental impact. Traditional coffee farming is done on a small scale in a complex agrosystem dominated by shade trees and often with generational methods of controlling pests rather than environmentally harsh chemicals, which, because of the farm’s biodiversity, are not necessary.
The large industrial companies that control much of the world’s imports of coffee benefit from higher yielding methods and until recently a majority of consumers didn’t mind the trade-off in quality to keep the price of their daily drink low. Zoom forward to today’s affluent “artisanal” and activist buying culture and in steps the traditional farmer’s savior - maybe. 
Fair Trade certified coffee reaches you through fewer hands than before, often skipping such intermediaries as traders and distributors. Certification also guarantees that growers are paid a floor price for their produce as well as other stipulations such as worker-owned cooperatives and investment in social development. These expenses should be seen as investment in human capital at the least and if you’re inclined to think so, as a moral imperative for the difficult labor that goes into something we generally take for granted.
Fair Trade Coffee as something official has been in existence less than a decade, but thanks to a vociferous body of activist consumers, that and other sustainable methods are coming into the mainstream. Starbucks is now the largest roaster of Fair Trade coffee in the U.S., yet, as the book points out and I’ve noticed myself, it would seem there are more brochures about Fair Trade in their stores than the actual coffee. The mixed message here is a sign that this movement toward awareness and sustainable culture (I chose that phrase carefully) is only getting underway.
The hopeful byproduct of expecting and getting quality foodstuff must come with an awareness of where it comes from and at least partial responsibility for its continued existence. Admittedly, this attitude is new to me; <em>The Coffee Book</em> came at a particular point in my own awareness of these issues and has made a general tickle of thought into a more informed and actionable opinion.
I didn’t begin reading <em>The Coffee Book</em> on page one because that was the “history of” section populated, I figured, with quaint tales of trade routes and kings usually required in books of this ilk. I began on a later chapter and only when I saw <em>The Coffee Book’s</em> comprehensiveness and overarching goal did I read through the center, go back to the beginning and then finally read through the final chapters that brought all the history, political and industry talk into focus on today’s American market.
As is obvious by now, I am sympathetic to the views of the authors’. The book, as I said, has an opinion and not all readers will be comfortable with that. My education is in economics so you might say I’m a trained skeptic, so at times I wondered if I might benefit from a different perspective, although I’m not sure where exactly that would come from. And despite its point of view, the book is thorough enough that readers will feel as though the argument before them is thoughtful and has a higher aim than merely pointing fingers at the bad guys.
My only complaint about <em>The Coffee Book </em>is the lack of action asked of the reader. With a clear aim at elucidating the market powers that have driven mediocrity and exploitation in the coffee business, Luttinger and Dicum leave us with a hopeful picture of an industry moving toward bringing Fair Trade, Organic and Shade Grown coffees into the mainstream, yet don’t supply us with our way of being a part of the movement besides a few resources hidden away in the notes and bibliography.
So, I’ll offer a few places for you to start supporting Fair Trade:
<a href="http://www.transfairusa.org/" title="http://www.transfairusa.org/">TransFair USA</a> has a “shop” section to find local and online stores as well as a wealth of information on the subject.
<a href="http://www.gorillacoffee.com/" title="http://www.gorillacoffee.com/">Gorilla Coffee</a> is a Brooklyn micro-roaster who sells excellent Fair Trade coffee.
<a href="http://www.fairtraderesource.org/resources/index.html" title="http://www.fairtraderesource.org/resources/index.html">The Fair Trade Resource Network</a>
In addition to supporting small local companies that sell Free Trade coffee, you might also consider asking your Starbucks barista to brew you Fair Trade coffee too. As much as I like to support indies, the green mermaid seems unavoidable  - and is in fact the only source of Free Trade coffee in some countries - and to the extent you do shop there, continued pressure on the company to bring Fair Trade into the mainstream may have a greater impact than anything else.
I would be remiss in not mentioning in this line-up the excellent <a href="http://thenewpress.com/" title="The New Press">The New Press</a> who published this book. They are a not-for profit publisher putting out books in the public interest. I can’t imagine too many non-academic publishers putting out a book like this and I think it’s important to do so.</p>

        Soundtrack to Pynchon’s “Against the Day”: Glass’s Plutonian Ode with Allen

Is there a new thing under the sun? &#8221;<br /> - Allen Ginsberg &#8220;Plutonian Ode&#8221;<br />
<br />
I recommend as a Soundtrack to Pynchon&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=159420120X%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/159420120X%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" title="Against the Day">&#8220;Against the Day,&#8221;</a> Philip Glass&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000BRF9T4%26tag=bookenompolic-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000BRF9T4%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" title="Symphony No. 6, Plutonian Ode">Symphony No. 6 &#8220;Plutonian Ode&#8221;</a> with Allen Ginsberg. You&#8217;re thinking this is absurd - I know - to say a modern symphony connoting nuclear disaster can capture, musically, themes from a book that begins and ends before plutonium was discovered, but I say to you it&#8217;s striking how well the music fits with the book.
</p>
<p>
First, the word itself is a great play: &#8220;Plutonium&#8221; is of course a radioactive element discovered (named) in 1942 for the planet Pluto because plutonium follows neptuniam in the periodic table of elements just as the (erstwhile) planet Pluto orbits beyond Neptune in the solar system. &#8220;Plutonian,&#8221; the name of Ginsberg&#8217;s ode, refers to Pluto, God of the world of the dead, deep within the earth, infernal, dismal. Get it? The two are intertwined in the Ode and most certainly in real life - Plutonian comes up in <i>Against the Day</i> on page 154 in context of the &#8220;DOLEFUL&#8221; metropolis (NYC?) where &#8220;Fire and blood were about to roll like fate upon the complacent multitudes...&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Besides the mood evoked by the title - and I haven&#8217;t finished the book yet - I do feel as though much of the scientific discussion in <em>Against the Day</em> premeditates the Atomic age and the hold it has on our lives.
</p>
<p>
The music itself has a grandeur - you may know Philip Glass scores a lot of films - that befits an epic like Pynchon&#8217;s and its grandeur, it seems, is self-mocking in such a way to belie the seriousness of its underlying themes.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m not, by the way, suggesting that you sit down with the music while you read the book - you&#8217;d get nowhere with either. The symphony - particularly the version with the Ginsberg reading that Glass superimposed over the music with Lauren Flanigan singing the very same libretto (poem) - stands on its own. But I often think about music and books or art forms that in their specific details relate to one another, throwing a different light on your thinking about them or expressing the story in a different way. I think the <em>Plutonian Ode</em> does that.
