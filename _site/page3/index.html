    <p>I surfaced an old short story of mine a while back and published it on the new publishing platform, <a href="https://medium.com/p/83c2bc4bd240">Medium</a>. You can read the story at Medium, (Medium says it will only take five minutes) but here’s the first sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the train this morning I stood next to a man reading the same book I was reading and on the same page.</p>

    <p>I wrote a piece called <a href="https://medium.com/lessons-learned/1747b9766f59"><em>What an Author Site Should Look Like</em></a> and published it on the new publishing platform Medium. You can read it there, but here’s an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nobody Cares About You</p>

  <p>This goes for any website. Readers don’t spend a lot of time on any website and they click very little. Blogs and about pages are often draws, but that’s it. Any website should do as little as possible and be about the person visiting it, not an overdesigned marketing-copy-ladened beast.</p>

        Me, The Summer Vacation Reading Issue
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2013</span>

    <p>FINALLY. Vacation. Long overdue and a chance to catch up on some reading. Here’s what I’m taking to the beach:</p>

<p><em>The Guy Davenport Reader</em>. I’ve read <em>Geographies of the Imagination</em> and <em>A Table of Green Fields</em>, which is incomprehensibly wonderful,  so this looks like an irresistible collection.</p>

<p><em>Hypothermia</em>, by Álvaro Enrigue. I’ve been waiting a long time for this collection, since reading Enrigue’s <a href="http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/on-the-death-of-the-author"><em>On the Death of the Author</em></a> at Words Without Borders.</p>

<p><em>Hawthorne &amp; Child</em>, by Keith Ridgway. I’m going in blind on this. The publisher (my client) is enthusiastic about it and there’s a blurb by Zadie Smith that says it’s “idiosyncratic” and another blurb that says that it’s “unpredictable.” Sounds good to me.</p>

<p><em>The Infatuations</em>, by Javier Marías. I often say that I never recommend Marías to anyone because you have to have a special patience for his writing (e.g. five minute scenes stretching out 80 pages or more), but I love his work, having read the <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em> trilogy and several other works of his (<em>A Heart So White</em> being another fave).</p>

<p>I think that’s it. I’ve been perusing a few things to take along but haven’t settled on anything. I wish there were a Bolaño I haven’t read. I’ll also be finishing up <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, which I’ve been reading with my son this year, though I have to take it slow because he gets upset if I get ahead of him, and he too is a grazer. I used to read a Shakespeare play every summer, but I think I have enough on my plate and it always makes me talk funny.</p>

<p>As you can tell, I’m not a pulp beach reader. Vacation is one of the few times I can immerse myself in a bit of reading these days, so I hate to waste that time.</p>

        Mixing Future and Past Dated Entries in Wordpress, with Date-based Filters
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2013</span>

    <p>We build web properties for publishers who are often promoting books that are not yet published. In Wordpress we treat the publish date of an entry as the publish date of the book. This presents a few problems in Wordpress showing yet-to-be-published entries, but we’ve been able to solve them with filters. Action hooks and filters are the most powerful feature of Wordpress, in my view. Used concisely and judiciously, they give you great control over how your content is displayed.</p>

<p>For a recent project for <a href="http://blpress.org">Bellevue Literary Press</a> we wanted to display the client’s books mixed in various ways based on the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have room for 9 books total in 3 locations. </li>
  <li>Location #1 shows 1 book: the most recently published.</li>
  <li>Location #2 shows 2 books, recently published, not including the book displayed in location #1 (solved with a simple “‘offset’ =&gt; 1”)</li>
  <li>Location #3 show up to 6 books, if there are any, that will be published in the next 7 months.</li>
  <li>Location #3 - If there are fewer than 6 books that meet the criteria in previous rule, then, and only then, we want to show the most recently published books that were not included in locations #1 or 2</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4051" alt="Bellevue-Literary-Press-_-Bellevue-Literary-Press" src="http://budparr.com/assets/img/uploads/2013/03/Bellevue-Literary-Press-_-Bellevue-Literary-Press.jpg" width="700" height="758" /></p>

<p>The first two locations are handled simply with an offset rule, so we’ll skip to location 3.</p>

<p><strong>First, create a function to define our date filter*:</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>function filter_where( $where = '' ) {
// posts from X to Y days 
   $where .= " AND post_date &amp;gt;= '" . date('Y-m-d', strtotime('0 days')) . "'" . "
               AND post_date &amp;lt;= '" . date('Y-m-d', strtotime('210 days')) . "'";
     return $where;
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The structure of this function gives me a bit of flexibility because when I wrote the code for this section I didn’t know what the specific time constraints would be. You can google for other ways to set your date parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Apply the function in a filter just before our query:</strong></p>

<p>source: Filter Reference/posts_where](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/posts_where)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>add_filter( 'posts_where', 'filter_where' );

$books_forthcoming_args = array(
       'post_type' =&amp;gt; 'product',
       'posts_per_page' =&amp;gt; 6,
       'orderby' =&amp;gt; 'date',
       'order' =&amp;gt; 'asc',
       'meta_key' =&amp;gt; '_thumbnail_id',
        'post_status' =&amp;gt; 'future'
               ) ;
 $books_forthcoming = new WP_Query( $books_forthcoming_args );

</code></pre>
</div>

<p><em>aside: note that I wanted to only show books that had a thumbnail image, so added “‘meta_key’ =&gt; ‘_thumbnail_id’,” to my parameters.</em></p>

<p><strong>Do a little math:</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$forthcoming_count = $books_forthcoming-&amp;gt;post_count;
$books_remaining = 6 - $forthcoming_count;

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The first line gives me a count of the results in the $books_list query.</p>

<p>The second line gives me my count of the total number of books I want to show, less the number of books I am showing with this query.</p>

<p><strong>I needed to manipulate my header based on results, so add this sort of rule to header:</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Recent&amp;lt;?php if ( $forthcoming_count &amp;gt; 0 ){ echo ' &amp;amp; Forthcoming'; } ?&amp;gt; Titles&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"&gt;Display posts in the usual fashion, then remove filter**

remove_filter( 'posts_where', 'filter_where' );  

</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Set up the second query using our $books_remaining variable to determine the number of books to show.</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>     $books_recent_args = array(
     'posts_per_page' =&amp;gt; $books_remaining,
     'offset' =&amp;gt; 3,
     'orderby' =&amp;gt; 'date',
     'order' =&amp;gt; 'desc',
     'post_status' =&amp;gt; 'publish'
     );

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>“‘posts_per_page’ =&gt; $books_remaining,” uses my earlier math to show the total number of slots available less the number of books shown in the first query.</p>

<p>“‘offset’ =&gt; 3,” - accounting for the books I showed in locations #1 and 2.</p>

<p>“‘post_status’ =&gt; array( ‘publish’ )” - only currently published books, please.</p>

<p><strong>Display Posts as usual.</strong></p>

<p>If you have any thoughts or comments on this, by all means, drop a note.</p>

    <p>I’ve often thought that if I were going to an MFA writing program I’d also study filmmaking. It’s not that I don’t value text - I do, wholeheartedly. But, there are a lot of stories, not necessarily feature films, that can be told as well or better with video. The famous/infamous critic Leslie Fiedler said that a masterpiece is a work that transcends its medium. His prime example was “Gone with the Wind.”</p>

<p>Here’s a perfect example for a short story being told with video. This short is based off of a story by Etgar Keret, a favorite writer of mine. His style of writing is well suited to this transcendence because he has a way of honing what he wants to the point of brilliant concision.</p>

<p>This short was played at the Sundance Film Festival, and it’s terrific:</p>
