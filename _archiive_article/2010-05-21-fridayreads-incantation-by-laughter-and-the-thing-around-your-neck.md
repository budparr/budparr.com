We had a little party the other night to celebrate the release of <em><a href="http://wordswithoutborders.org/books/#the-ecco-anthology-of-international-poetry">The Ecco Anthology of International Poetry</a></em>. Twenty or so people gathered in a beautiful Manhattan apartment with the treat of having the renowned poet, and president of the Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, Edward Hirsch read to us from the anthology. It's a massive collection so to pick a couple of poems to represent the whole is difficult, but Hirsch picked one that I think actually represents the challenges of poetry and translation. The poem is Velimir Khlebnikov's "Incantation by Laughter" in which Khlebnikov riffs, in Russian, on the various ways to express laughter in his language. Paul Schmidt did a fantastic job of creating something that I have to imagine recreates the original while creating something wholly new. Here are the first five lines:
<blockquote>Hlahla! Uthlofan, lauflings!

Hlahla! Uflofan, lauflings!

Who lawghen with lafe, who hlaegen lewchly,

Hlahla! Uflofan hlouly!

Hlahla! Hloufish lauflings lafe uf beloght lauchalorum!</blockquote>

I've also been reading Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's stories collected in <em>The Thing Around Your Neck.</em> This book will be passed around from English and writing teachers to students for years to come. Her stories are flawless. Perhaps even a bit too good. Emotionally distant. Though that may be unfair to say just yet. Here's a video of her TED talk: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story.html">Chimamanda Adichie: The danger of a single story</a>

<em>#FridayReads is a twitter phenomenon where people share what they're reading. It's a fun exercise, but 140 characters doesn't seem enough...</em>
