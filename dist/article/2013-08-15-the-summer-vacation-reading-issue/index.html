<p>FINALLY. Vacation. Long overdue and a chance to catch up on some reading. Here’s what I’m taking to the beach:</p>
<p><em>The Guy Davenport Reader</em>. I’ve read <em>Geographies of the Imagination</em> and <em>A Table of Green Fields</em>, which is incomprehensibly wonderful,  so this looks like an irresistible collection.</p>
<p><em>Hypothermia</em>, by Álvaro Enrigue. I’ve been waiting a long time for this collection, since reading Enrigue’s <a href="http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/on-the-death-of-the-author"><em>On the Death of the Author</em></a> at Words Without Borders.</p>
<p><em>Hawthorne &#x26; Child</em>, by Keith Ridgway. I’m going in blind on this. The publisher (my client) is enthusiastic about it and there’s a blurb by Zadie Smith that says it’s “idiosyncratic” and another blurb that says that it’s “unpredictable.” Sounds good to me.</p>
<p><em>The Infatuations</em>, by Javier Marías. I often say that I never recommend Marías to anyone because you have to have a special patience for his writing (e.g. five minute scenes stretching out 80 pages or more), but I love his work, having read the <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em> trilogy and several other works of his (<em>A Heart So White</em> being another fave).</p>
<p>I think that’s it. I’ve been perusing a few things to take along but haven’t settled on anything. I wish there were a Bolaño I haven’t read. I’ll also be finishing up <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, which I’ve been reading with my son this year, though I have to take it slow because he gets upset if I get ahead of him, and he too is a grazer. I used to read a Shakespeare play every summer, but I think I have enough on my plate and it always makes me talk funny.</p>
<p>As you can tell, I’m not a pulp beach reader. Vacation is one of the few times I can immerse myself in a bit of reading these days, so I hate to waste that time.</p>
