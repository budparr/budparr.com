Here are some options for adding search and/or filters to your static website. These have various approaches, costs and ease of implementation.

- [Lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com/) (plugins: [Jeyll](https://github.com/slashdotdash/jekyll-lunr-js-search), [Metalsmith](https://github.com/CMClay/metalsmith-lunr))
- [List.js](http://listjs.com/)
- [Swiftype](https://swiftype.com/)
- [Tipue Search](http://www.tipue.com/search/)
- [Google Custom Search Engine](https://www.google.com/cse/)
- [Tapir](http://tapirgo.com/)
- [Jekyll search with JSON](http://mathayward.com/jekyll-search/)

The less-technically inclined may want to look at something like Swiftype (paid, but has a limited free option), Tapir or Tipue. I use List.js extensively for filtering and recommend it highly.
