        Quartz and the New The New Republic

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2013</span>

    <p>We’re going to see myriad new redesigns of magazine and newspaper websites as the landscape shifts online. I’ve been studying some of these and am working on forming educated opinions. I’m very much enamored with <a href="http://qz.com/">_Quartz’s</a> design (it’s not a redesign, but a new publication). Everything makes sense to me: immediately hitting readers with something to read, and nary a pixel wasted. The site’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">reponsiveness</a> is superb, simply because they must have designed mobile first, something that is more difficult than it may seem. However, this tablet-centric design is not for everyone. <em>Quartz</em> is streaming news, so their design is unique to the problems of presenting a lot of news to an audience with a short attention span.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/assets/img/qz-com.png" alt="Quartz" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/"><em>The New Republic</em></a> just days ago relaunched their website and iPad app. They’re solving a different problem: engaging readers now while still interesting them in subscription only content or products. The home page feels like a print magazine cover; dramatic, positively retro and low information density. One wonders if the cover will be “art-directed” each month, though I’d wager given the publisher’s pedigree that they will be testing and adjusting at the least.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/assets/img/tnr-home.png" alt="" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What’s interesting about the <em>TNR</em> design is the article page. Elements shared with one of my other favorite content designs, <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, are centered text with a large font. <em>TNR</em> is using 16px “Publico Text” (interestingly there doesn’t appear to be a font stack for <em>TNR</em>. oversight, or the way embedded fonts need to work?), which is about 20% smaller than Medium’s 20px (measured, roughly, by cap height) and a generous line height, slightly less than Medium’s. While I think Medium really nails typography, <em>TNR</em> does pretty good, compared, for example, to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2013/01/29/rim-prepares-to-launch-new-blackberry-for-the-hyper-connected/"><em>Forbes.com</em></a>, which flubs the type on article pages by not venturing past Georgia (not the worst thing) and not getting line height right.</p>

<p>But there’s lots going on here besides type. You may not notice at first, but there’s a progress bar up top. This is something that readers may soon come to expect. This one is subtle enough to be useful yet not get in the way of reading.</p>

<p>Someone at <em>TNR</em> was brave enough not to pack article pages with all the garbage we’re used to seeing at the NYTimes.com. There are side-notes to the right. I love these, though not the link color, which I think directs to much attention to itself. Features like sharing, type-size adjustment and audio buttons are up top. Those buttons move to the top of the screen when the reader scrolls the article.</p>

<p>Though it’s not a design feature, cross-device syncing of articles will also be something that readers will soon come to expect.</p>

<p>I don’t particularly care for stark white backgrounds for reading, but I suppose that’s just a matter of preference.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s a successful imprint of the new publisher. The home page is an interesting and needed departure, though it remains to be seen if this particular style will be successful with readers.</p>

    <p>This is a cross-post of my comment on Andrew Piper’s article on Slate: <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/11/reading_on_a_kindle_is_not_the_same_as_reading_a_book.single.html">“Out of Touch - E-reading isn’t reading.”</a> Piper says:</p>
<blockquote>"I no longer pause over the slight caress of the almost turned page—a rapture of anticipation—I just whisk away."</blockquote>
<p>This is sentimental and anti-intellectual. What would Dostoyevsky, for instance, say if he heard that his words meant so little without some trifling material satisfaction?</p>

<p>Indeed, Tim Parks points out at the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/feb/15/ebooks-cant-burn/">New York Review of Books</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>"The e-book, by eliminating all variations in the appearance and weight of the material object we hold in our hand and by discouraging anything but our focus on where we are in the sequence of words (the page once read disappears, the page to come has yet to appear) would seem to bring us closer than the paper book to the essence of the literary experience. Certainly it offers a more austere, direct engagement with the words appearing before us and disappearing behind us than the traditional paper book offers, giving no fetishistic gratification as we cover our walls with famous names. It is as if one had been freed from everything extraneous and distracting surrounding the text to focus on the pleasure of the words themselves. In this sense the passage from paper to e-book is not unlike the moment when we passed from illustrated children’s books to the adult version of the page that is only text. This is a medium for grown-ups."</blockquote>
<p>And Mr. Piper’s assertion here is inexcusable:</p>
<blockquote>"And as one study after another affirms, the more time we spend reading screens, the less time we spend reading individual units of the text. Skimming is the new normal."</blockquote>
<p>These studies are about reading on the web in general, not strictly books, and to suggest otherwise indicates some sort of reaching for evidence that doesn’t exist. I would certainly like to see the studies (study after study!) that indicates that reading books on a screen causes one to skim. Reading, in fact, is the new normal.</p>

<p>What the sentimentality of this article ignores is the reality books and reading face today. Ebooks represent an opportunity for access and choice. So many children around the world don’t have the luxury you describe, and literacy is - amazingly - a major issue around the world. Ebooks are helping to solve that problem. For many of us, ebooks allow us to fit in reading, or read things previously inaccessible. No longer do we have to choose the edition that happens to be available sitting on a shelf, or suffer small typography, or read a small book because we can’t take a large book with us.</p>

<p>No one among ebook advocates - to my knowledge - condemning the printed book in any way. I would imagine the strongest proponents, like myself, have homes full of printed books. But we love reading above all and some historical notion of what reading is supposed to feel like seems merely silly.</p>

    <p>xwuWQTeDRriYcdgfJ3AqVhXjapk4MmKB is an example of what one of my passwords looks like. I also use Google’s double authentification (which is a royal pain) for my gmail and work email accounts, and each of my passwords to public sites is different.</p>

<p>DO THIS.</p>

<p>I, obviously, use a password manager. There are other ways, but if you are still hanging on to your dog/kid password or something else that seems unique to you but really isn’t it is time to change your ways. Nate Silver says you have a 92% chance of getting hacked*.</p>

<p>Here’s the NY Times with some advice “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/technology/personaltech/how-to-devise-passwords-that-drive-hackers-away.html?src=me&amp;ref=general">How to Drive the Password Hackers Away</a>”.</p>
