There's no other word for it but Kitsch, and it's all over the iPad, from Apple's own apps to the horrible AP News app. Hopefully this sort of thing will shake out, except that it seems that Apple is responsible for it. Follow the link below for a really thoughtful post on designing for the iPad:
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Everybody in the iA team strongly doubted the validity of that particular guideline. Yet since we had no way to reality check it, we went full steam ahead: <em>Everything 3D! Make a newspaper look like a newspaper! Make that wordprocessor look like a type writer! Use wooden backgrounds!</em> And why? Because Apple said so.</blockquote>
