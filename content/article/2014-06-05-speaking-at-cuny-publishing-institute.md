Today I spoke for the 2014 class at the [CUNY Publishing Institute](http://cpi.journalism.cuny.edu/) run by John Oakes of [OR Books](http://orbooks.com/). Here's a great article John wrote about the Institute for the _Journal of Electronic Publishing_: ["By the Book: A New Approach to Teaching the Art of Book Publishing"](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0017.208/--by-the-book-a-new-approach-to-teaching-the-art-of-book?rgn=main;view=fulltext).

And, while they weren't part of the slides, we also talked about using Markdown when writing for the web and static site generators. Here are my two posts about those topics:

["The Basics of Markdown Tutorial"](http://www.budparr.com/article/2014/03/09/markdown-tutorial/)

["Want to Speed up Your Website? Skip the Database"](http://www.budparr.com/article/2014/03/06/static-site-generators-introduction/)
