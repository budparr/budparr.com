    <p>Let me walk out on the stage by saying that surprise is a literary touchstone for me. That said, when one looks to be surprised by a work of fiction, it is all the more difficult to be caught out. To hope to be surprised, to look forward expectantly to being taken by surprise, is more than likely to cancel out the possibility. And what do I mean after all by surprise here? Everything original in the best sense is surprising in its way, which is to say that the great books continue to surprise even though our prior experience with them lets us think (gives us that jading illusion) that we know what&#8217;s coming next. Once we are familiar with the twists of a surprising plot, unless we have conveniently faulty memories, we can never be surprised by them again. The books I&#8217;ve admired, and continue to admire, have other ways of engendering surprise.</p>
<p>A favorite quote of mine from the French filmmaker Robert Bresson exhorts the artist &#8220;to bring together things that had not been brought together before and had not been predisposed to be so.&#8221; That&#8217;s the kind of surprise I believe I&#8217;m talking about&mdash;the surprise of flying in the face of the received rules. The writer among my contemporaries, whom I find the most surprising and therefore the most admirable, is Robert Coover, a household name only in the most enlightened households. Virtually all of Coover&#8217;s fictions tend to have the quality of surprise that the Bresson quote refers to, which is at least one determinant of their&#8217; pleasure for me. If I have to choose a single book of Coover&#8217;s to recommend, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m committed to doing, I would choose the seemingly modest novella, the playful, mock-pornographic, &#8220;Spanking the Maid&#8221;&mdash;a book I&#8217;ve presented to my classes at Brooklyn College over and over again&#8212;because (and why not?) the choice is itself a surprise.</p>

        Your Face Tomorrow: Dance and Dream, by Javier Marias
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2008</span>

    <p> How to describe <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em>? Its title tells us nothing about what happens in the book and the subtitles of the individual volumes (it&#8217;s a three volume novel, two of which have so far been translated into English and published by New Directions), &#8220;Fever and Spear&#8221; and &#8220;Dance and Dream&#8221; are not quite motifs but something like mental markers, like, perhaps, the titles given to Abstract impressionist paintings. While there is action and even a story in <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em> I think it would be unfair to describe this novel that way. The story follows Jack Deza, an urbane Spaniard in England whose wife has left him, as he gets a job in the British Secret Service judging the truthfulness (loosely termed) of the unwitting diplomats, spies and other characters who pass through the agency&#8217;s halls. While that story certainly has potential, I would mislead you if I told you that&#8217;s what the book is about. Everything that happens in a Mar&iacute;as novel is a colorful backdrop or even pretext for ruminating on the subject Jack or his creator are thinking about. And that&#8217;s closer to the point than the story in and of itself. </p>
<p>Javier Mar&iacute;as&#8217;s  extravagantly digressive writing ranges from sensuous to dialectical and meditative, but occasionally banal to the point of distraction. Like Lauren Hutton&#8217;s gapped teeth this can be endearing rather than a flaw that would make lesser writers intolerable, but for a writer who can easily stretch a five minute event through 70 or 80 pages or a sentence to Proustian proportions, he seems willing to risk breaking the rhythm so crucial to his style for the sake of grounding his characters with an awkward, sometimes puzzling naturalistic whimsy. </p>
<p>In <em>Dance and Dream</em>, volume two of the <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em> trilogy, Deza is ordered by his mysterious quasi-secret agent boss Tupra to search the toilets for a eurotrash diplomat and a dignitary&#8217;s wife who&#8217;ve gone astray together in a London nightclub. This bathroom scene &#8211; a great deal of this second volume takes place in the toilet, although it might be more accurate to say it takes place inside Deza&#8217;s mind &#8211; begins on page 89 and ends nearly 70 pages later with Deza&#8217;s thoughts just walking out the door of the toilet starting from page 121. </p>
<p>The scene encompasses not only his search of the nightclub&#8217;s restrooms but ruminations on themes began in the novel&#8217;s first volume <em>Fever and Spear</em> such as meditations on violence and the Spanish Civil War, &#8211; Deza&#8217;s father survived the war from the losing side but not without a great deal of suffering &#8211; remorse over estrangement from his wife who is still in Spain, and the tiny detail of a drop of blood, which occupies a central point in volume one and reappears in a different although related context here. The drop of blood takes on many symbolic possibilities but at the least it creates a bond between volume one and two, endowing the primary setting of both books with a physical puzzlement and the novelistic possibilities of questioning its source.</p>
<p>This is why we read Mar&iacute;as, for his thoughts keyed by the events at hand, events that seem inconsequential for their only purpose is to provoke Deza, to spur his brooding, to lead us through his history or the history of his country, to watch from afar the way we humans treat one another, how we behave when we&#8217;re alone. Besides these larger themes, Deza&#8217;s mind dips into country song lyrics, women&#8217;s legs &#8211; &#8220;So there it was, that line of legs&#8221; &#8211; and naturally, the state of the toilets. In a later scene in the restrooms for the disabled, he muses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;equally generous was the excellent lighting, intended, I assumed, to avoid the possibility of any stumbles, everything was new and spotless, gleaming and even welcoming, without any of the sordid elements so frequent in public toilets. It was admirable that people should show such respect for the disabled of Britain, that they did not cheerfully invade it and soil and besmirch it, as is the norm among men and optional among women.&#8221; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as vaguely naive or even silly, yet a few moments later, more or less, banality veers into a nearly absurd act of violence. Here Mar&iacute;as revels in the detail of the moment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I saw the look on his face, the look of someone who thinks or knows he is dead; but since he was still alive, the image was one of infinite fear and struggle, mental struggle, perhaps of desire&#8217; of childish, undisguised terror, his mouth must have dried instantly, as instantly as his face turned deathly pale, just as if someone had give his face a quick lick of grey or off-white or queasy-colored paint, or had thrown flour over him or perhaps talcum powder, it was rather like when swift clouds cast a shadow over the fields and a shudder runs through the flocks below, or like the hand that spreads the plague or closes the eyes of the deceased.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read in a recent <a href="http://theparisreview.com/viewinterview.php/prmMID/5680">Paris Review</a> interview that Mar&iacute;as writes as he goes, intensively focusing on one section at a time, never looking back on a passage. It&#8217;s easy to muse that the inconsistencies, if you could call them that, in his writing might be due to a lack of coffee one day, or too much, or a Laurel and Hardy movie on television, maybe a song on the radio, a random phone call from a friend. The fact that he pulls this off, at least in my view,  says a lot about Mar&iacute;as. He is not a writer for everyone, indeed I&#8217;d call him something of an intellectual elitist, both in tone and content, but to unflinchingly transcend story as he does puts him in a rare category of writer.</p>

        Classics: On Edith Wharton by Roxana Robinson
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Jul 2008</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve always been drawn to Edith Wharton&#8217;s work, partly because of its astonishing combination of elegance and urgency, and partly because her world is so familiar.</p>
<p>Wharton and I come from similar backgrounds. I grew up with the rules that governed her: emotions were to be strictly controlled, pain was not to be acknowledged, and the rules of decorum were to be obeyed. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by her unblinking exegesis of all this, the way you are when someone breaks the rules, the way you are when you read something and think, &#8220;What? Are you allowed to write about this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wharton wrote about her world in a way that made it possible for me &#8211; and for all of us who come after her &#8211; to go into our own worlds still further, and to tease out the innermost reaches of pain and passion from the decorous woven fabric of our lives.</p>
<p>The following is excerpted with permission from the introduction to <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=7152"><em>The New York Stories of Edith Wharton</em></a>:</p>
<p>A writer&#8217;s world both shelters and confines, and she must write her way both into and out of it. She must form her own world, but it will always be part of the one that formed her. It will always be both beginning and end of her journey.</p>
<p>Edith Newbold Jones was born in 1862, in the family brownstone on West 23rd Street. Her forebears were Dutch, English and Huguenot &#8211; a long line of successful merchants, bankers and lawyers. They were well-established, and at the time of her birth, Edith&#8217;s family had lived in New York for nearly two hundred years. Old New York was an insular, tribal society, with a rigid caste system and a strict code of behaviour. The code of manners governed all aspects of behaviour, including frivolous ones of social comportment. At the core of this code, however, was a stern Puritan ethos of moral rectitude, self-reliance and a stoic disregard of pain. Edith learned the rules of this formal, restrained world, but she also felt the presence of another, unacknowledged one. This held emotions and ideas, and it seethed around her like an invisible mist. Wharton learned the power of the secret, forbidden realm, that the laws of decorum were set up to control and counteract. The conflict between these worlds &#8211; the mannered, mandarin one, and the passionate, uncontrollable one  &#8211; would provide the central dynamic of her work.</p>
<p>Despite moving to Europe, Wharton never gave up her American citizenship, however, and her deepest literary and  emotional connections always remained to her world &#8211; Old New York. Her first novel, a historical romance called The Valley of Decision, was set in Italy. When it was published, in 1902, Henry James had famously advised her: &#8220;Use the American subject! Do New York! There it is round you.&#8221; But New York was already Wharton&#8217;s subject; she had been &#8220;doing&#8221; it in stories for over a decade, and would continue throughout her career. New York was the center of her life, the place where she had struggled most ardently with conflicting claims of manners and passion, the place where her heart had beat most powerfully; where her soul had seemed most desperately constrained and her happiness most perilously at risk. In her work, New York received her greatest scrutiny, sternest criticism and deepest understanding. It was her greatest subject. In her New York stories, we find all of Wharton&#8217;s great themes: stifled passion and the suffocating soul; the conflict between idealism and pragmatism; the charged erotic constellation of marriage, adultery, divorce and betrayal.</p>
<p>One of the richest and most fertile themes in Wharton&#8217;s work was that of the complicated connection between love and pain. Wharton&#8217;s own romantic history was not happy: her first engagement was broken off, not by her. A second romantic relationship, disappointingly, did not produce an offer. Her marriage to Teddy Wharton was neither passionate nor fulfilling, and ended in misery. Her brief erotic engagement with Morton Fullerton was wounding. These experiences are reflected in her fiction: rarely are her central male characters both sympathetic andeffective. Those who are sympathetic are often passive or uncommitted; those who are powerful are often evasive and opaque, solipsistic or brutal. The presence of a subtle emotional sadism runs like a dark undercurrent through Wharton&#8217;s fiction. The same troubling theme is strikingly present in &#8220;The Dilettante,&#8221; written in 1903, long before her affair. Perhaps her most shocking story, &#8220;The Dilettante&#8221; is a subtle disquisition on cruelty. Thursdale, an idle and worldly bachelor, maintains an amitie amoureusewith Mrs. Vervain, an elegant divorcee. Cold, cynical and controlling, Thursdale considers their relationship, and the &#8220;emotional training&#8221; he has given Mrs. Vervain. As the narrative unfolds we learn of his decision to marry &#8211; though not, of course, the well-schooled Mrs. Vervain. He has found a fresh, untainted young woman. With sublime effrontery he asks his mistress to support his marriage suit, persuading the young fiancee of Thursdale&#8217;s worth. The lethal potency of the story arises partly from Mrs. Vervain&#8217;s intelligence and vitality: she seems to have deliberately chosen this ghastly thralldom, this humiliating emotional martyrdom. In return for it she receives only a cruel intimacy. Love is what she wants, but it is not offered,  and she is too well-trained to make a scene.</p>
<p>Wharton wrote brilliantly right up to the end of her life, and &#8220;Roman Fever,&#8221; of 1934, just three years before her death, is one of her great stories. It is not a quiet rumination on mortality, but the summoning up of rage, stifled passion, and sexuality: a remarkable work for a woman of seventy-two.</p>
<p>Though the story is set entirely on a rooftop terrace in contemporary Rome, Old New York is a looming presence, and provides the background of &#8220;two American ladies of ripe but well-cared for middle age.&#8221; Friends since childhood, brownstone neighbours on East 73rd Street, now both widowed and the mothers of two marriageable daughters, the two sit      decorously watching the sunset &#8220;&#8230;contemplating it in silence, with a sort of diffused serenity which might have been borrowed from the spring effulgence of the Roman skies.&#8221;  Mrs. Slade thinks slightingly that her friend&#8217;s late husband &#8220;was &#8211; well, just the duplicate of his wife. Museum specimens of old New York. Good looking, irreproachable, exemplary.&#8221; Slowly, through dialogue and flashbacks, the two recall their young womanhood,  inducting us into its secret sisterhood as they remember a common visit to Rome some twenty-five years earlier. If New York represents a moribund rigidity, Rome embodies a dark, charged vitality, worldly and unfathomable. The fever of the title refers to malaria, a fatal nineteenth-century disease and a real threat before the Roman marshes were drained. Fever was the ostensible reason for keeping young women inside during the evenings. The risk of illness was real, but so was the other, unspoken reason for sequestration &#8211; sexual adventure, with its terrifying consequences.</p>
<p>Seated overlooking a ravishing twilit view of Rome, with its &#8220;great accumulated wreckage of passion and splendor,&#8221; the women are carried by the march of memory, to  the rising rhythm of animosity, through a landscape of jealousy and deception, illicit assignations, sexual thrall and unwed pregnancy. It is a virtuoso&#8217;s performance, and Wharton&#8217;s greatest story of old New York may be this one, set in Rome. Here Wharton reverts to her most enduring theme, the power of passion. It is passion that has driven the lives of these two decorous matrons, and it is passion that reveals itself anew, as they sit in the splendor of the Roman sunset.</p>
<p>Edith Wharton&#8217;s lifetime spanned the Victorian era, the First World War, the Jazz Age, and the Depression. It was a period of enormous transitions, and subject to the competing forces of conservatism and modernism. The great changes she witnessed are reflected in her work, against the backdrop of old New York. Wharton&#8217;s writing is difficult to place. She schooled herself by reading non-fiction: history, philosophy and scientific theory. This gave her a firm intellectual grounding and a rational, analytical approach to the world. She admired the novel of ideas, and the work of George Eliot and George Sand. Because of the elevated social circles of her characters, as well as the subtlety and nuance of her work, she has often been compared to Henry James, a mentor and friend. James was a very different sort of writer, however, and his vision was interior and more mysterious than hers. Wharton&#8217;s work had more clarity and directness, more boldness and drama.</p>
<p>Wharton wrote about the twentieth century, but, by her formal, ceremonial style and her belief in a moral order, she was linked inextricably to the nineteenth. The next generation of writers &#8211; Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald, among others.  &#8211; shared a sense of post-war disillusionment, and they experimented with literary styles that reflected the fractured rhythms of the twentieth century. Despite her decorous style, however, Wharton is anything but prim. Her work is informed by candor, clarity, and a deep  understanding of the great subversive force of the emotions. Perhaps only one for whom the life of the emotions has been so explicitly forbidden can truly understand the potency of that life.</p>
<p>Wharton&#8217;s work was overlooked for many years because of its awkward placement, stranded between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Returned now to its rightful prominence in the history of American letters, it offers a profound and moving reflection on desire and its consequences, on freedom and its limits, in American life. Her New York stories show Edith Wharton&#8217;s world as she knew it. They show the crystalline brilliance of Wharton&#8217;s literary style; they show the intellectual reach and the complexity of her mind. They show the courage, depth, and compassion of her heart. They show her to be one of our greatest short story writers.</p>

        Dominique Fabre’s The Waitress Was New
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2008</span>

    <p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/waitress_thumb.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:18px" alt="altimage" /> <br />
<br />
&#8220;They never forget what they are, or all the things they have to do, but for a few minutes, maybe an hour or two, they put themselves between parentheses, and I bear the name of that thing in their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p><br /><br />
To choose one word to describe Dominique Fabre&#8217;s <a href="http://www.archipelagobooks.org/bk.php?id=41"><em>The Waitress Was New</em></a> it would have to be &#8220;quiet.&#8221; A short novel of 117 pages, Fabre&#8217;s first translated into English, <em>The Waitress Was New</em> is a peek into the consciousness of a Parisian bartender over three days at the end of his career. </p>
<p>The story begins as Pierre is introduced to a new waitress at La Cercle, a small, non-descript restaurant on the outskirts of Paris:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>	&#8220;What I really wanted to say was &#8216;Welcome to the Club,&#8217; and then give her some tips on the questions she was probably going to ask. The boss isn&#8217;t much of a talker, but he&#8217;s him and I&#8217;m me. I&#8217;m only the oldest employee of Le Cercle, which is the caf&eacute; where I work, across from the Asni&eacute;res train station, where there&#8217;s nothing to see but people coming and going out&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;She had a firm grip, when she let go I noticed she had a big wedding ring on her left hand, and I wondered if that&#8217;s really where it&#8217;s supposed to go. That was all too long ago for me, maybe I&#8217;d forgotten. Still, I&#8217;d stayed married for eight years, I was a young man then. I kept my ring on at first. Then I put it in my nightstand drawer. I lost a lot of illusions, but not her. My ex remarried, lived happily; and had two children. Then unhappily, and still two children. Then we lost touch. Her name was Marie, like my adoptive mother. The boss looked around, he&#8217;d picked up his cigarillo again.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pierre is matter-of-factly attuned to his environment because he is the one person not passing through. He&#8217;s a fixture like the bar itself. He listens more than he talks, he observes more than he listens. But for his attentiveness he doesn&#8217;t seem to learn much. He acts as though he understand others&#8217; relationships but his own are withered, distant or shallow. He thinks he gets what&#8217;s going on around him but then is sideswiped by the truth. Much of the novel surrounds the disappearance of &#8220;the boss&#8221; (which in French is, I think, &#8220;le boss&#8221;) and everyone&#8217;s speculation, including the boss&#8217;s wife, that he&#8217;s having an affair with one of the restaurant&#8217;s former waitresses. Pierre stumbles confidently through what seems to him a given only to be met later by the truth and throughout he never truly doubts himself.</p>
<p>In depicting someone on the side of society (not on the margins, just side, if you will) Fabre slips into a barely comfortable pathos. Pierre is neither particularly likable or unlikeable and his existence appears without purpose or meaning. The affect is a lack of tension such that we pity Pierre &#8211; the man can&#8217;t even bring himself to masturbate &#8211; but don&#8217;t care about the outcome of the story. This is why I think of <em>The Waitress Was New</em> as quiet. It doesn&#8217;t try to draw attention to itself, just like Pierre. If we had any doubts of Pierre as something of an anti-hero, Fabre casts him firmly against Pierre&#8217;s own reading material that he, naturally, learns about through a customer at the bar: Primo Levi&#8217;s <em>If this is a Man</em> &#8220;the story of a Jewish Italian resistance fighter who lived through the concentration camps, he wanted to bear witness.&#8221; &#8220;Now there&#8217;s somebody I&#8217;d like to have as a customer,&#8221; says Pierre of Levi. </p>
<p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/bartender_thumb.png" style="float:right;margin-left:18px" alt="altimage" /> Where Fabre excels is accreting pieces of Pierre&#8217;s world into a somewhat whole portrait. While the drama is not exactly intense during our brief time with Pierre and Le Cercle, Fabre wastes not a word, packing in layers of detail in every paragraph. Looking at the quote above (beginning with &#8220;What I really wanted to say), Pierre gives us glimpses of the new waitress (married, probably strong-willed), the boss (silent type, which might be odd for a restaurant owner, owns a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris, smokes cigarillos), Pierre&#8217;s ex-wife (divorced, happy, two children, unhappy) and himself (long-time employee of Le Cercle with a fondness for his job, older, divorcee, adopted). </p>
<p>Of course, our observations are limited to what goes through Pierre&#8217;s mind, leaving sketches of the boss, the new waitress, the bosses wife and other characters merely impressions. We can only come as close to them as Pierre and he is nothing more than an onlooker on these lives, but still the richness lies in what we don&#8217;t know about them. I suspect in reading this novel that I&#8217;ve come a little closer to a life about which I knew nothing before, the kind of life that I might pass by with little thought. I may not be any closer than Pierre comes to his customers, filling in blanks where needed with imagination, but that is an oddly compelling pastime. </p>

    <p>We all have our favorite books, and not a few of us are probably influenced by those we read when we were children. But often when we go back and look again, they&#8217;re disappointing; we see their tricks and the manipulations of an author.</p>
<p>Some of those books, though, were remarkably able to touch both children and adults, and for me, there is nothing quite like Kipling&#8217;s &#8220;The Jungle Book,&#8221; published in 1894, which affected me as a child and still has a hold on me. I particularly mean the first one (he published &#8220;The Second Jungle Book&#8221; a year later) and its three stories about Mowgli, the wolf-boy, although it&#8217;s hard not to love &#8220;Rikki-tikki-tavi,&#8221; which records the life-saving battle between a loyal mongoose and a particularly nasty cobra.</p>
<p>You read these stories today and you say, &#8220;Wow!&#8221; Mowgli is a far more interesting character than his epigone, Tarzan, even if he has power approaching those of a superhero. (He can speak bird and snake and tiger, and so on; and, when the time comes, learns human speech.) Kipling doesn&#8217;t anthropomorphize, or not much, but Mowgli&#8217;s friendships with Bagheera, the gentle, deadly black panther, and Baloo, the professorial bear, and the wolves who reared him, are touching and realized. Kaa, the rock python, and the loathsome Bandar-log &#8211; the amoral monkey tribe &#8211; are grand fictional characters.</p>
<p>Kipling was such an accomplished stylist, too; in the 1890s &#8211; in the time after Dickens and before Arnold Bennett &#8211; he wrote clean, elegant sentences that leapt beyond the stilted prose his place and time. Hemingway might have written this from &#8220;Tiger-Tiger,&#8221; the third Mowgli story: &#8220;At one end stood a little village, and at the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds, and stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe.&#8221; In that story, Kipling does something that I never understood when I was a kid: He writes from Mowgli&#8217;s point of view, but also through the eyes of Indian villagers, who are startled by this boy (by now about twelve or thirteen) who can&#8217;t communicate and appears to have bites all over his body.  And Kipling being Kipling, he stage-manages a fine adventure in which Mowgli finally confronts Shere Khan, the vengeful tiger who has stalked him since he was a baby, left in the jungle and adopted by the wolf pack.</p>
