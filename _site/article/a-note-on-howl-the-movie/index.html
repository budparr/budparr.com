  <p><strong>A movie about a poem? Really? How does that work?</strong></p>

<p>Well, it helps if the poem was famous, and great, and had its own obscenity trial. It’s a nice reminder of how great the poem is, particularly when read aloud, and particularly in the face of the fact that there are still lots of places in this country where books are banned.</p>

<p><strong>But is it good? </strong></p>

<p>I went during the day to spare my wife having to sit through a movie about a poem. I was on my own and nearly walked out of the theater several times.</p>

<p><strong>So it’s bad?</strong></p>

<p>Not exactly. <a href="http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/film/89268/howl-film-review">Time Out New York</a> panned it. That’s too bad. They panned James Franco’s reading too, saying he “did little more than mimic Ginsberg’s squeaky tenor cadences,” calling him “too hipster-primped by half.”</p>

<p>I thought Franco’s reading was very good, the highlight of the film, along with the interview scenes  (based on actual records). Maybe the Time Out  reviewer is an expert, I don’t know, but I’ve read the poem myself, aloud, and I’ve listened to it read by Ginsberg what seems like a million times. The early recording [<a href="http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Ginsberg/SFSU-1956/Ginsberg-Allen_04_Howl_SFSU_10-25-56.mp3">link</a>] of Ginsberg reading it isn’t great, but he does build momentum (and, seemingly, confidence) as he goes on, just as Franco did. A later recording, which is set to Lee Hyla’s string quartet, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000005J3N/qid=1077325102/sr=1-13/ref=sr_1_13/102-6487001-3036120?v=glance&amp;s=classical">Howl,</a>” and recorded in, I think, 1994, is a more mature Ginsberg when he really had come into himself as a reader. It’s a great great reading. There’s a stark difference between the two. Franco’s reading is set when Ginsberg had just recently written it. His performance seems not only <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2010/09/james-franco-howl-aurally.html">accurate</a>, but to some degree transporting and enjoyable.</p>

<p>The trial segment was “good” (Don Draper playing John Hamm, playing Ferlinghetti’s attorney, Jake Ehrlich) and the flashback scenes were  ”okay” (I’m assuming that if you’re reading this, you’ve at least seen summaries or the film itself). The weaving of these elements I think was, nonetheless, a brilliant way to present the poem in film, largely letting it (and the record) speak for itself.</p>

<p><strong>So, what’s bad enough that you’d want to walk out?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://ginsbergblog.blogspot.com/">Allen Ginsberg Project </a>calls the animation scenes “underappreciated.” I think they’re just an abomination. Granted, in any other context they’d be considered artful and accomplished, but I agree with A.O. Scott in the <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/movies/24howl.html?pagewanted=all">NY Times</a>, who said…</p>
<blockquote>It is as if an earnest, literal-minded undergraduate had set out to illustrate “Howl” without understanding the essential difference between poetic and pictorial imagery, a distinction that was hardly lost on Ginsberg, a gifted photographer who counted William Blake among his crucial influences.</blockquote>
<p>They were utterly distracting, so much so I wanted to hide my eyes, or worse, just leave the theater. They were jolting as though an ad or different movie had come on suddenly, and of course, they were insulting to the poem.</p>

<p>Watch the trailer below. There’s probably a reason you don’t see the animations much. Maybe one day there will be a <em>people’s</em> cut with a blank screen over those scenes.</p>

<p>Also see the “<a href="http://ginsbergblog.blogspot.com/">Allen Ginsberg Project</a>” blog for links to a host of other opinions. <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/HowlTheMovie">Levi likes the animations</a>.</p>
