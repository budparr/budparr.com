I am an entrepeneur, web developer and designer, [JAMStack engineer](https://jamstack.org/), content strategist, and public speaker.

I've worked for over 20 years at my own firm, The New Dynamic (formerly named Sonnet Media). I earned a Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts from New York University.

In my spare time, I run the [The New Dynamic](https://www.thenewdynamic.org/) project and [JAMStack Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/the-new-dynamic/), helping other web professionals  with front-end web technologies.

I'm also interested in cooking and bread baking. A purist at heart, I roast my own coffee and maintain my own bread starter. I also enjoy music and photography, though for the last 13 years most of my photography has been of my beautiful children.

I live in the Bronx with my wife and three sons.
