<div style="float:left;margin-right:15px"><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/bpy_thumb.jpg" /><br /><span class="small"></span></div><p>If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve become addicted to your iPhone in the oddest ways, even though the phone service itself is horrible. I use it as a flashlight when I walk my son to the bathroom at night, and everyone knows it&#8217;s a great distraction for your kids (<a href="http://iphoneappdemos.tv/2009/02/bebot-robot-synth/">Bebot</a>, <a href="http://brushesapp.com/">Brushes</a>). That is if you can get it away from them or if they don&#8217;t make odd phone calls or emails to your clients (if you&#8217;ve ever gotten an email from me with nothing but &#8220;yrixoxyt&#8221; in the body, it came from Seamus).</p>
<p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/shorteroed.png" width="103" height="111" style="float:right;margin-left:8px" /> Among the myriad practical little apps, I became obsessed with &#8220;The Weather Channel&#8221; app over the summer, hoping each time that the little cloud icons would turn to sun (they never did). But what I truly love about my iPhone is the <a href="http://www.mobisystems.com/product.html?p=13&amp;l=1&amp;pid=281&amp;i=1">Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</a> app. For me, that alone is worth the price. Yes, it&#8217;s expensive for an iPhone app, but we&#8217;re talking about a massive dictionary, second only to the <span class="caps">OED</span> itself, always at your side (My other preferred dictionary, the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2009-07/Webster.html">controversial</a> Merriam-Webster Unabridged, I use online, if needed). The truly geeky can even use the &#8220;random word&#8221; button &#8211; when faced with nothing else to do &#8211; until you find something you don&#8217;t know. </p>
<p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/indiebound_thumb.png" width="150" height="148" style="float:left;margin-right:8px" /> More than once I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/iphone">IndieBound&#8217;s</a> iPhone app for looking up books when the conversation hinges upon remembering that author (and anyone who knows me knows I have a horrible memory). &#8220;The something Hedgehog, wasn&#8217;t it&#8230;?&#8221; yes, he says confidently, &#8220;Elegance of the Hedgehog&#8221; with the iPhone under the table. </p>
<p>Of course, the reader wars are upon us, with <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000301301">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/iphone/">Barnes &amp; Noble&#8217;s</a> e-readers, among others, competing &#8211; on what, I don&#8217;t know. I did manage to read Robert Louis Stevenson&#8217;s <em>Treasure Island</em> on my iPhone via Stanza when my five-year-old lost interest in the hardcopy we were reading. But I&#8217;ve yet to be convinced that it&#8217;s worth paying for any books there besides maybe something to read in an emergency &#8211; you do know about reading emergencies, don&#8217;t you? </p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, despite the promise of e-readers, the so-called &#8220;long-tail&#8221; doesn&#8217;t yet exist. When the entire backlist of New Directions, Dalkey Archive and so on are available in the Kindle store, then maybe. </p>
<p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/shakespeareplay.png" width="259" height="176" style="float:right;margin-left:8px" /> Feel like brushing up on the play while waiting in line for your Shakespeare in the Park tickets? Read it on the free <a href="http://playshakespeare.com/news/3668-shakespeare-on-iphone-update?q=iphone">playshakespeare</a> app, a companion to the PlayShakespeare.com Website. You&#8217;re limited to only one version (First Folio of 1623 and the Globe Edition  of 1866), but it&#8217;s quite a comprehensive app and will leave you sifting through sonnets for hours on end. </p>
<p>On the margins of usefulness, there&#8217;s <a href="http://iphoneapps.oreilly.com/2009/07/next-read.html">Next Read</a> that allows you to keep lists of books and who recommended them. </p>
<p><img src="http://sonnetmedia.net/images/uploads/electroniclit_thumb.png" width="175" height="160" style="float:left;margin-right:8px" /> So many apps, many more I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know about, but I think one of the most interesting apps for the iPhone is one surely to help you out in a reading emergency: <a href="http://www.electricliterature.com/index.html">Electric Literature</a> is a lit-mag with versions in paper, Kindle, e-readers and the iPhone (although, unfortunately, the iPhone version is only for one issue, not a subscription). Short stories by authors you may or may or may not know at your finger tips. When carrying around the latest issue of <a href="http://www.brickmag.com/"><em>Brick</em></a> isn&#8217;t an option, you&#8217;ll find plenty to keep you busy with &#8220;Electric Literature.&#8221; The app doesn&#8217;t have all the bells and whistles of other e-readers, but it does have the one thing that&#8217;s paramount no matter what form&#8230;the text. </p>
